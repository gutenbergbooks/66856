  <h2>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Poet, sailor, Grizzlebeard—this trinity sums up, not only
the man who is Hilaire Belloc, but the vision of integrated
humanity concretized in his work. Bellocian humanism is
Hilaire Belloc grasped in the essence of his spirit, seen at
the center of his being. Only a detailed biography will
reveal to this generation the full flavour, the magnificence,
of this latter-day Villon.</p>

<p>Nonetheless it seemed to me that the perfections symbolized
by the Poet, the Sailor, the Grizzlebeard are not
the peculiarities of one man whose life has spanned almost
two ages. They are perfections essential to the integral
completion of Christian humanity. With this thesis in mind,
I wrote this book: an attempt not only to introduce the
contemporary reader to Belloc, but also an attempt to disengage,
from the vast corpus of Bellociana, those themes
that are of permanent value.</p>

<p>What follows is not a biography, nor is it a book of
literary criticism. It is, if you like, a “metaphysics of the
concrete” seen through the eyes of a man rooted in the
things that are.</p>

<p class="capsub1">NO ALIENATED MAN</p>
<p class="capsub2">The Four Men: Natural Humanism</p>
</div>

<p>The ancient Arabs spoke of a creature having life in two
worlds: his body was rooted in the earth, but his soul swept
out across the horizons to a world beyond. Let us call him
by his name: Man. This balance which is Man is a tension
rarely maintained in the course of human existence.</p>

<p>Let us call the one who situates his destiny in this world,
and who habituates his gaze to the things this side of the
horizon, Aristotelian Man. Let us call the one who
 despises
the limits of the horizons, and who contemplates the world
beyond, Platonic Man.</p>

<p>This first alienation of man from himself was healed in
the ancient world by the Incarnation. Aristotelian Man, like
St. Thomas the Doubter, could put his fingers in the side
of his Creator; and Platonic Man, like the mystic John,
found the Word, but it was the Word made Flesh. Revelation
restored to man the unity that was himself. <i>Anima
naturaliter Christiana</i>. This unity was achieved as a reality
both personal and corporate for a period of time in that
small segment of the globe known as Western Europe.</p>

<p>Human unity was gradually lost, and a new man came
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
into being. This man has his life neither in the rooted
things of the world nor in a heaven beyond. Nor is he
Christian Man, man reconciled to himself. This new man
looks neither outward and above nor outward and round
about him. He looks within, and attempts to find his salvation
by a penetration and purgation of the hidden depths
of his own personality. This is Modern Man, man twice
alienated from himself, and he has not yet found his soul.
“<i>Je est un autre</i>,” said Rimbaud. “I IS an Other.” And yet
the Other which he is, is shrouded in darkness; and it is in
this crucifixion of himself that Modern Man has come to
see, without knowing that he sees, the hidden irony of
the Cross.</p>

<p>Rimbaud was to wreak his vengeance on this Other he
could not find by denouncing poetry, and by turning to
what consolations the sands of Africa and the keel of a
slave ship could offer an alienated man. He was a forerunner
of what has become the dominant motif of the
Western soul as expressed in its literature: the Man of Guilt.</p>

<p>Guilt is the effect of estrangement; it follows on a renunciation,
explicit or implicit, of some dimension of the
human spirit which is essential to the integral perfection
of man. This renunciation has nothing to do with asceticism,
which is a discipline sanctified and defined by the
Christian tradition, having as its goal the flowering of
human existence. The ascetic is an artist who prunes away
the irrelevant so that the end may be achieved. Alienation
is altogether different. It is the renunciation of something
without which the end cannot be. Hence, wherever you
find this sense of guilt so preoccupying modern man, you
find a rupturing of the human heart, a positive surrender
of some value which is consubstantial with achieved, completed,
personal perfection. Being cannot be mocked with
impunity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>A
whole body of literature has grown up within the last
seventy-five years devoted to exploring and understanding
the estrangement of contemporary civilized man. That
this body of art, chiefly found in the novel, should deal
with the expatriate seems extremely significant of the crisis
facing man today. One need only recall the world of
Henry James to find an apt symbol for the modern dilemma.
This New Englander left his American home to
find himself in a Europe that existed chiefly in his imagination.
Some of his best work is an attempt at penetrating
into the restlessness and homelessness of the Western soul.
James is full of trans-Atlantic crossings.</p>

<p>His short story “Four Meetings” brings out the paradox
of alienation. It concerns a young New England school
teacher who yearns for the day when she can see the
Europe of her dreams. She succeeds after years of work
and saving, but is tricked, when her boat docks in the Port
of Le Havre, into turning over her money to a young man
who claims to be a distant cousin. She returns to New
England by the next ship. James ends the story on a note
of delicate savagery: the wife of the cousin, a bogus
countess from the streets of Paris, comes to America to
live with and off the young school teacher, now disillusioned,
alienated, but desperately maintaining the situation
out of a sense of decency, and out of the need to hang
onto the frame of an illusion, rather than face the irony
of the complete nothingness of her existence.</p>

<p>The irony is deepened in that this aging school mistress
of Boston Puritan antecedents symbolizes James himself
in his relationship to the older culture that he sought to
know, and yet never penetrated to its depths. James remained
an alienated man. All of this suggests the true story,
so heavy with possibilities, that G. K. Chesterton recounted
about James.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1">[1]</a>
Chesterton had taken a summer house in
Rye, and James, “after exactly the correct interval,” made
 <span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
a formal call, accompanied by his brother William. Everyone
talked politely of one thing and another, mostly letters,
until a roar went up from the garden; two bearded, unkempt
tramps burst in on the delicately poised teacups,
and sang out boldly for beer and bacon. It was the introduction
of Henry James to Hilaire Belloc, and to the
reality of that European tradition that ever remained a
stranger to the New Englander. Chesterton suggests that
the profound significance of this encounter eluded Mr.
James, whose subtle mind seemed incapable of coping with
anything beyond the shadow of a reality. Belloc bulked
too big for him.</p>

<p>He continues to bulk too big for the generation that has
carried the estrangement of James to its preordained and
lonely end. Belloc incarnated a sanity and a vigour that
reached back to Chaucerian England and the Paris of
François Villon for roots. For this reason he has always
irritated the advance guard of spiritual decay. He seems
too confident of himself, too dogmatic. There is a healthy
earthiness sustaining all his work that is too solid, too full
of substance for the intellectual attuned only to broken
men. Belloc has fed himself on reality, and he has tasted
its bitterness and its salt. He has affirmed being. In so doing,
Belloc has accepted whatever can genuinely nourish and
sustain the fabric of human existence. He is not starved.</p>

<p>There is to be found in his work no trace of that sense
of guilt in simply being a man that so defines the modern
spirit. Belloc’s Christian conscience is keenly aware of the
limitations of human perfection, and his soul is soaked in
a healthy conviction of the fact that sin has rendered us
all more or less ugly in the sight of God. Belloc wrote
once that “man, being man, has a worm in his heart.” He
penetrated into the reality of evil and his healthy realism
and high integrity prevented him from surrounding sin
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
with the glamour of a “mystique.” Guilt, for Belloc, was
the result of a failure in human nature; it was not rooted,
as it is for the contemporary mind, in the very fabric of
human existence. It is because of this that Belloc parts
company with the contemporary mind, which is almost
ashamed to be. Every other emotion, every shade of feeling
and nuance of thought can be found within his vast
literary output: irony, humour, a deep pathos that never
degenerates into sentimentality, hate, piety, rigorous logic,
a profound gravity that at times only Christian hope rescues
from despair, tenderness, love; all these in abundance, but
guilt—guilt in the mere fact of existence—is nowhere to be
found, because Hilaire Belloc is, in every sense of the term,
an unalienated man.</p>

<p>If Belloc is almost completely incomprehensible to the
post-war intellectual (even the post-war Catholic intellectual),
the lack of understanding can be traced to the
amazing personal integration of the man, and to the lack
of a comparable integration today on the part of those most
representative of the modern spirit. The ambiguity of
Belloc’s position in English letters is rendered still more
pronounced in that he spans three well-marked and sharply
differentiated generations, while his work deploys itself
over an extraordinary number of apparently diverse fields
of interest. To some he is known as the founder of the
Distributist movement in English economic thought. To
others he is the intransigent enemy of parliamentary government
and monied aristocracy. In the field of letters, he
remains the author of <i>The Path to Rome</i> and of a host of
delightful essays that reveal a man profoundly at home in
the hills and fields of South England and the Latin Continent.
To most, the name Belloc probably conjures up a
Catholic Apologetic, for the first time not defensive, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
aggressive, militant, and confident in the superiority and
the justness of its cause.</p>

<p>In time, Belloc encompasses not merely three generations,
but two ages. To a youth maturing into manhood
in the second half of the twentieth century, his name may
mean an era that never was. Born in the year of the fall
of the third Napoleon and the proclamation of the German
Empire in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles, Belloc marched
in the dust of the caissons of the Third Republic when the
return of the white flag of Bourbon still hung like a threat
and a promise over the fields of France. His first book was
minted in the presses while Victoria was still Queen
of England. In him the Oxford Movement of Newman
yielded its finest harvest, and Edwardian London was filled
with the sound of his laughter, the vigour of his person, and
the early splendour of his prose. He belongs to an age
now dead.</p>

<p>The total significance of the man cannot be grasped by
isolating him within his time, nor by analyzing separately
his accomplishments in the dozen and more disciplines in
which he laboured. The specific Bellocian theses—his
espousal of both French Republicanism and the monarchical
principle, his distributist economics, his defence of
the Western continuity with Rome, his doctrine on the
relationship between Catholicism and Europe, his contempt
and his arrogance before all things demonstrative
of the modern temper—march forth and deploy themselves
controversially as commanded by an essential, integrated
position that can only be called classical in the larger sense
of the word. It is for this reason that the causes for which
Belloc fought so long and so eloquently can be understood
in all their grandeur, and can be evaluated objectively and
with full sympathetic precision only if his cardinal intuition
is explored and fully grasped. Above all else, Belloc
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
is an unalienated man: a representative of a rarely achieved
ideal, that of the integrated Christian humanist.</p>

<p>The integrated man achieves himself by making his own
all those dimensions of human personality and perfection
which when isolated one from another seem mutually incompatible.
Integration is a steady struggle. It is not usually
characterized by any sudden and dramatic affirmation
or negation; it does not lend itself easily to artistic depiction.
Integration grows from within, and if it flowers in
grace and the supernatural order, it has its roots in the
hidden depths of natural man. The classical humanist spirit,
whether it be found in the pre-Christian or in the Christian
world, always aims at placing before man an ideal that is
neither angelic nor animal, but human, and which is therefore
limited in the way man is limited. It is an ideal oriented
in harmony with the reserves of reality at hand to human
beings. For the humanist hopes to unite perfections in the
concrete order of existence which, if left to themselves,
would tend to conflict. The Christian humanist places his
faith and hope in the Incarnation not only as a doctrine
to be believed, but as a Divine vindication of the intrinsic
goodness of man and of the world in which he lives. He
restores all things to God, not by suppressing them, but by
seeing in them the Creative Act which is the patent letter
of nobility to whatsoever is, in any sense, being. A Christian
humanist realizes that he cannot be a Christian man
unless he is first man, and hence his supernatural life is
grounded in a natural life which has been harmonized.
Unfortunately Christian humanism has more often remained
an academic ideal than a reality, and in a day in
which human dignity is more and more suppressed in a
society increasingly inhuman in its techniques and accomplishments,
a man who actualized within himself this ideal
to an astounding degree should grow in significance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
Belloc’s centralized personality was not given him; it was
achieved. His realization of his own destiny does not appear
as an easy victory, but as something battled for. It is precisely
in that battle that its grandeur lies.</p>

<p>The most articulate and symbolic statement of the natural
humanism underlying his militant Catholicism is to be
found in Belloc’s <i>The Four Men</i>, a curious “Farrago” written
rather early in his career. This book reveals the necessity
of harmonizing the separate drives in man if man
would be himself. It faces man with the paradox of natural
humanism: its insufficiency in the face of death. Man, after
a struggle, wins the battle against personal alienation only
to face an alienation that strikes at deeper roots: an alienation
of his very self, of his very being.</p>

<p><i>The Four Men</i> is a book filled with an earth-sadness, and
an almost pagan prescience of the passing of things. A
favourite theme of Belloc’s, the mood of the second of
November, All Hallow’s Eve, the Night of the Dead, runs
like a somber motif through the entire work. The South
English countryside, the land of Sussex, the author’s own
county, is permeated with an autumnal gloom; the hills
and the valley of Arun, the surf booming quietly in the
night, the sea air stiffening the drama of things, all this is
threatened by a dissolution, not so imminent as to rob
nature of its beauty, but present enough to render more
lovely the things that pass.</p>

<p>“Myself” sits in the inn <i>George</i>, “drinking that port of
theirs and staring at the fire,”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2">[2]</a> and moved by thoughts of
youth and of the river Arun, he arouses himself and resolves
to be off to see his home once again. He is joined
by an old man (still vigorous against the march of the
years) who lets himself be known as Grizzlebeard. The
following day, October 30, 1902, the two men are met by
a Sailor, a fellow in the full flood of life, a singer of songs
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
and a profound realist; and the company is completed by
a Poet, a man with visions and no money. The Four Men
join in a pilgrimage to “the land they know.”</p>

<p>They pass through the Sussex weald regaling one another
with stories and songs, and they speak of the “Worst
and the Best Thing in the World.” That night they rest
in a hut. The next day is given over to good bacon and to
the singing of many songs, among which is the incomparable
“Bishop of Old Auxerre.” It is in this fashion that
they arrive by easy stages at the house of Myself, where
they rest until the following morning. The next night, the
first of November, finds them at a little inn, and Grizzlebeard
engages a philosopher, a “metaphysician,” in heated
conversation over the ultimate causes of things.</p>

<p>On the second of November, Myself awakes “from a
dream,” and Grizzlebeard tells him solemnly that it is the
day of parting. The Four Men walk slowly and silently
through the mists until they take “that lane northward
which turns through Redlands and up to the hill of Elstead
and its inn.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3">[3]</a> Then they break bread together for the last
time in the communion of friendship, and the Three, led
by Grizzlebeard, part company from Myself, who until
the very end protests and urges yet another day of comradeship.
Grizzlebeard replies:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There is nothing at all that remains: nor any house; nor any
castle, however strong; nor any love, however tender and
sound; nor any comradeship among men, however hardy. Nothing
remains but the things of which I will not speak, because
we have spoken enough of them already during these four days.
But I who am old will give you advice, which is this—to consider
chiefly from now onward those permanent things which
are, as it were, the shores of this age and the harbours of our
glittering and pleasant but dangerous and wholly changeful
sea.”</p>

<p>When he said this (by which he meant Death), the other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>two,
looking sadly at me, stood silent also for about the time in
which a man can say good-by with reverence. Then they all
turned about and went rapidly and with a purpose up the
village street.</p>

<p>I watched them, straining my sad eyes; but in a moment the
mist received them and they had disappeared.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4">[4]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Myself hurries on “into the loneliness of the high Downs
that are my brothers and my repose.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5">[5]</a> Alone, somewhat
shaken and bitter in his dereliction, he passes quickly over
the burial mounds of the old kings of Sussex.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I ... felt the full culmination of all the twenty tides of mutability
which had thus run together to make a skerry of my soul.
I saw and apprehended, as a man sees or touches a physical
thing, that nothing of our sort remains, and that even before my
county should cease to be itself I should have left it. I recognized
that I was (and I confessed) in that attitude of the mind
wherein men admit mortality; something had already passed
from me—I mean that fresh and vigorous morning of the eyes
wherein the beauty of this land had been reflected as a tiny
mirror of burnished silver. Youth was gone out apart; it was
loved and regretted and no longer possessed.</p>

<p>Then, as I walked through this wood more slowly, pushing
before me great billows of dead leaves, as the bows of a ship
push the dark waters before them, this side and that, when the
wind blows full on the middle of the sail and the water answers
loudly as the ship sails on, so I went till suddenly I remembered
with the pang that catches men at the clang of bells what this
time was in November; it was the Day of the Dead.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6">[6]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Pushing on in this mood, dark with the mystery of death
and the soul, Myself comes at last to the platform over
Barl’ton, where to the east stretch the Downs and to the
south lies the sea. Brooding over the communion of man
and his fields, Myself thinks of the children on the plain
below just coming into the world he must soon depart.
Putting pencil to paper, he gropes toward poetic expression
of the chaos within him, and as his emotions are incarnated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
in verse a song of hope emerges. The Dead do not
die. They remain, if only to people the land of their birth
as ghostly influences from beyond the grave. And on this
note of doubtful affirmation, the book ends almost as
mysteriously as it began.</p>

<p>What is one to make of this strangely moving work?
Considered artistically, the book is almost a literary curiosity,
not only when viewed in the context of the Bellocian
corpus, but even when situated in the larger field of English
letters. There is nothing quite like it in modern literature,
and Belloc’s farrago cannot be judged by standards appropriate
to the novel or indeed to any other <i>genre</i> familiar to
contemporary criticism. On one level <i>The Four Men</i> is
clearly patterned after the medieval allegory. The personages
depicted are archetypes. Grizzlebeard is symbolic of
the wise man of the folk, full of ancient lore, singing dirges
of the race and of the passing of youth. He is the custodian
of the household gods, and philosophy is not unknown
to him. He stands for order, historical continuity, and he
views existence with a realism born of age and wisdom.
Grizzlebeard is the tribal count, the feudal baron, the
landed squire: he is Tradition incarnate. The Sailor represents
man’s communion with the physical universe: he is
the eternal adventurer, the spirit of romance. Although
attached to Sussex, his eyes are in love with sudden landfalls
and distant hills. He is the wanderer in all men. The
Poet, lean in body and ragged in appearance, is a man
whose visions trip him up; he is not at home in this world,
but he belongs to that company of Eternal Poets, the Seers
of Western Tradition, that reach back to Plato.</p>

<p>These Three are archetypes of Man, as Las Vergnas
has pointed out,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7">[7]</a> and Belloc succeeds in maintaining their
physical separation <i>visually</i> by delineating sharply distinct
physical types, indicating distinct spiritual or psychological
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
types. And yet the whole movement of action throughout
the four days clearly indicates that these three must become
one. On one level they are distinct men. On a deeper level
they are Myself, and Myself is clearly Hilaire Belloc.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8">[8]</a> <i>The
Four Men</i> is thus more than a mere allegory; it presents
itself to us as a complexity of meaning: the three men are
companions necessary to the welfare and happiness of
Myself; they are Archetypes of Man, particularly Western
Man; they are dimensions of the personality of Myself.</p>

<p>The identification of the Three with the One is achieved
by Belloc through the use of irony, a device he frequently
employed in a peculiarly French manner. The man called
the Sailor is clearly of that calling: “these eyes of his were
veiled with the salt of the sea.” But he is not simply a
Sailor, as he would be in a mere allegory. He composes
finer verse than does the Poet, a fellow he good-naturedly
despises for his singular <i>lack of perception</i>: a dual use of
irony, in that the Poet fails in that precise attribute in
which he would be expected to excel. Grizzlebeard, the
sage, when asked what is the Best Thing in the World,
replies: sleep. His intellectuality and wisdom are countered
by a naive naturalism. Although personifications on
one level, the Four constantly contradict their surface
symbolism. This gives them individuality, and it also furthers
their identification with one another and with the
personality of Myself.</p>

<p>This ironic ambivalence ministers to the key significance
of <i>The Four Men</i> which Grizzlebeard reveals in his assertion
that “Estrangement is the saddest thing in the world.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9">[9]</a></p>

<p>Myself must be joined by the Three Men in his journey
through Sussex, his passage through life, because these three
are essential to the fullness of his own personality: to its
integrity and completion. Belloc seems to be saying that
there is a Poet, a Sailor, and a Grizzlebeard in each of us.
Let them be nourished. Without the lifting of the soul to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
the horizons, without at least a confused sense of man’s
belonging to a world which is not this one, without the
visions of the Poet, a man is starved. Without the spirit of
adventure, of youth, the awakening to the hills and the
sea and to the love of woman and the spirit of song, without
these things, without the Sailor, a man is over-subtle
and refined beyond health. He inclines to decadence, to
false mysticism, and to a pride that feeds on itself. The
Sailor baptizes the idealist metaphysician with a pint of
beer in “the name of the five senses.” He carries religion
with a smile. And a man without a Grizzlebeard is a man
without home, without traditions, without accumulated
wisdom. He is a man without a past, unmarked by distinction.
He lacks roots and is alone.</p>


<p>Hilaire Belloc’s initial integration is seen in this human
trinity which is one. What heightens the significance of
<i>The Four Men</i> is the almost total lack of a comparable
integration on the part of that intelligentsia most representative
of the modern Western world. Because of the
religious rupturing of the Christian center of European
society, even natural man lies broken in pieces, and the
pieces continue to splinter with the passing of time. While
this is not the place to probe exhaustively the causes of
this fissioning of the human spirit, the fact might well be
called the Great Evidence of the age.</p>

<p>The alienation of modern man has resulted on the
natural level, because these three are not one. Myself is
not Myself, but is an Other. Estranged from his past, uprooted
from the land of his fathers, cut away from his
origins, modern man is largely a stranger lost in a wilderness
of pavements. He lacks a Grizzlebeard. He has not
that bond of family of which T. S. Eliot speaks: “A bond
which embraces ... piety towards the dead, however obscure,
and a solicitude for the unborn, however remote.”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10">[10]</a>
Abstracted from the actual existence of things by a science
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
intent on constructing its own universe, he has been told
that the Sailor in him, the man “of the five senses,” is a
naive realist who is duped by appearances that are not what
they seem to be. Existence can be for him only Nothing,
and this last alienation clothes Guilt with the dignity of
a philosophical category. Existentialist man, modern man
as mirrored by Sartre and Camus, is the final broken man.
The alienation of the Poet is probably the most terrible of
the lot: told that he must construct his own universe by
a criticism and an aesthetics rotten with Idealism, he labours
under the impossible burden of aping God, and ends frequently
enough by playing the Devil. That is why a man
must exorcise the Poet in himself and turn to a life of action
as in Rimbaud, or to a life dedicated to the ideals of an
outmoded Enlightenment as in Thomas Mann.</p>

<p>Mann’s Tonio Kröger is told by Lisawetta Iwanowna
that his guilt stems from the fact that as an artist he is
alienated from conventional society. Adrian Leverkühn
keeps his art only at the price of selling his soul to Satan.
Conrad’s Heyst, faced with self-betrayal to a philosophy
of aloofment from existence, can do nothing but effect
the final alienation: suicide. Sartre’s heroes, all damned
quarter-men, quiver viscously in closed places without
exit. The modern intellectual seems driven to carve the
human form into pieces, and then to worship in trembling
the suffering he has himself caused.</p>

<p>Thus vigour has departed from art, and evil itself is given
over to clinical weariness. Literary reputations are gained
in proportion to one’s “sin mystique,” and one would think,
contrary to the express words of Saint Paul, that conversion
to Christ must follow on a season in hell. Suffering is
the fashion, and a well-turned cross is one’s ticket of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
admission to a literati that makes capital of the Crucifixion.
It is the contemporary version of the thirty pieces of silver.</p>

<p>Yet those who have gone through this darkness and who
have come out again into the world of being opening out
to the Being of God, can understand the tragedy of the
modern soul. It is a tragedy rooted in a profound misunderstanding
of the nature of being and knowledge. Precisely
where the tragedy begins is shrouded in mystery, but it
may perhaps be said that Joseph Conrad stands at the crossroads
where Western man deserted the last remaining traditional
values and struck out into the unknown. Conrad’s
brilliant short story, “The Secret Sharer,” is both symbolic
and symptomatic of the crisis of alienation modern man
invented for himself.</p>

<p>A young sea captain, new to his exalted position as
master of a full-rigged ship, finds a man of his own years
clinging to the bow of the vessel. Alone and still somewhat
unsure of himself before his veteran crew, the captain’s
heart goes out to the swimmer; unknown to his crew, he
hides the fellow aft in his cabin, only to discover that he
is harbouring a fugitive. The man is guilty of the unpremeditated
murder of one of the sailors who served under
him in a nearby vessel in which he had been chief
mate. The captain looks upon the escaped sailor as his
double, and he feels in some strange way that he <i>is</i> this
other, this criminal. In order to find himself, he must rid
himself of his “double.” He permits the fugitive to escape
by swimming ashore, by means of a daring maneuver in
which he almost destroys his ship by sailing her within
striking distance of the land, before bringing her about on
the new tack. When the vessel comes about on her new
tack, just short of piling up, the captain sees that his
strange friend and double has escaped by swimming to the
land. A confidence in himself surges through him, and he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
knows that he is now Master indeed. Thus the captain discovers
himself in the Other; but the Other had to be exorcized
in order that the Captain, Man, could genuinely
become himself.</p>

<p>Modern man, mirrored in the modern artist, realizes his
destiny by casting out the other selves that he finds in his
soul. By an extension, contemporary atheist existentialist
philosophy teaches that <i>all</i> others—things, and persons—are
set over against the self, threatening its existence: the
world is a hedge of hard spikes aimed at the heart of the
person, menacing it with otherness. All values, all wills,
and all being together are but the positive nothingness of
the Myself. They are one’s non-being. The philosophy of
Sartre (a symptom of a universal malaise), in which the
“in itself” is discovered as the negation and the opposite
of the “for itself,” presents a world in which the very discovery
of personality is constituted by an estrangement of
man from existence. The alienation of the soul is the condition
of its destiny. Only in nausea, anguish, disgust and
dread can man learn that to be himself is not to be anything
else. We are all Strangers, even to our own consciousness
of ourselves.</p>

<p>If “The Secret Sharer” symbolizes, even obscurely, the
birth of the New Man, <i>The Four Men</i> is the last picture
of the Older Man—the Man of Christendom. Belloc’s position
takes on an added interest when it is seen to be the
exact opposite, point for point, of man’s situation in the
world as conceived by contemporary literature and philosophy.
Myself is rendered one and whole in becoming
these Others, without which Myself cannot be Myself. In
becoming the Poet,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11">[11]</a> Myself enters into a world of beauty
and of all those visions that have ever stabbed at the heart
of man calling him to a world only vaguely seen. In becoming
the Sailor, Myself takes his stand within the physical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
universe of things: the universe of being. In becoming the
Grizzlebeard, Myself conquers the past, and transcending
the world of space, he enters into the dimension of time
wherein he is one with his fathers and the ages.</p>

<p>Thus Belloc’s <i>Four Men</i> might be called Thomistic; not
in the sense that Belloc is a professional philosopher, but
simply that his vision is oriented in the direction Aquinas’
was, in the direction any Christian’s is—toward reality. The
revelation of the self to itself is had in knowing things
other than the self. This is indeed the very definition of
knowledge as it has been understood in the Western
World: man knows himself in knowing other things, and
to know is to be, or to come to be, the Other as Other.
I first know what is not myself, and in the not-myself I
am revealed to myself. I conquer the distance between
myself and the Other by feeding on all things and values,
for being is the proper nourishment of man. Unless I
forget myself in the Other, I shall never be Myself. He
who would gain his soul must lose it.</p>

<p><i>The Four Men</i> represent the natural and classical foundation
of Belloc’s personal integration. He makes his own
these archetypes of Western Men of that Western culture
in which human nature most fully came into its own. The
Poet, the Sailor, and the Man of Wisdom are the classical
unities that underlie traditional Christian values. Belloc’s
Poet is as old as the Republic: he is less a man of art than
a man of dreams; Belloc’s Sailor looks to Homer; and Grizzlebeard,
while English to the core, echoes the Augustan
strains of Virgil.</p>

<p>Myself is one with himself in these companions. But all
the comradery, the good fellowship, the hearty wisdom,
and the love exchanged between friends is threatened by
what one might call the possibility of classical or human
alienation. Man is not his own enemy in Belloc’s farrago;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
Death is the enemy. The campfire blazes in the woods and
the inn is full of decency and laughter, but the universe
in the background breathes mutability and is marked for
the harvest. The seasons rise and fall. Generation issues into
corruption and the rich leaves of autumn prefigure the
coming of death. Even the County of Sussex, marked for
eventual dereliction, will yet outlive man.</p>

<p>Myself finds his soul in these companions, who part
from him after Grizzlebeard warns Myself, Man, to meditate
Death. Then “the mist received them and they had
disappeared.” Myself, troubled in spirit, faces the dilemma
Everyman faces. Must this humanity, found and achieved
in these four, be swallowed up in the mists? Must alienation,
“the saddest thing in the world,” claim the soul in the
end? Why discover ourselves and then come to realize
that we have found an illusion? We cannot come to be
ourselves finally unless Death itself die in the end. The
Night of the Dead has always been the night of their
return, and Belloc implies throughout his closing chapter
that this prefigures eventual immortality. He states this
more explicitly in an essay from <i>Hills and the Sea</i> that is
given over to meditating the meaning of autumn.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... at this peculiar time, this week (or moment) of the year,
the desires which if they do not prove at least demand—perhaps
remember—our destiny, come strongest. They are proper to the
time of autumn, and all men feel them. The air is at once new
and old.... The evenings hardly yet suggest (as they soon will)
friends and security, and the fires of home. The thoughts
awakened in us by their bands of light fading along the downs
are thoughts which go with loneliness and prepare me for the
isolation of the soul.</p>

<p>It is on this account that tradition has set, at the entering of
autumn, for a watch at the gate of the season, the Archangel;
and at its close the day and the night of All-Hallows on which
the Dead return.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12">[12]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
It is only when life is lived close to the senses, and when
the intelligence is brought to bear immediately on what is
yielded to man through the body, that the paradox of sadness
in created beauty can be brought home in all its
delicacy and inexorableness. Page after page of Belloc’s
writing, from early youth to old age, is troubled by a deep
melancholy, heightened by his profound communion with
the things of his world: English inns, old oak—polished and
sturdy, rich Burgundy, the sea and ships that sail, the smell
of the tides. These loves run through Belloc’s essays as
recurrent themes, testifying to a vision, movingly poetic,
that is classical in its simplicity. His gaze is rooted in the
primal things that have always nourished the human spirit:
in the things at hand.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Every pleasure I know comes from an intimate union between
my body and my very human mind, which last receives,
confirms, revives, and can summon up again what my body
has experienced. Of pleasures, however, in which my senses
have no part I know nothing.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13">[13]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Here is a man who believes that great beauty is best
found in the common: the common transfigured. This is
the food which is the proper nourishment of man. Here
peace is at hand. And yet this grasp of natural beauty in
Belloc sharply points up the paradox with which the last
chapter of <i>The Four Men</i> is concerned. The more sane man
becomes in taking to himself those perfections needed for
his fullness, the more bewildering appears his plight. His
personal integration demands the final unalienation of immortal
happiness; and yet happiness eternally possessed,
man’s only possible goal, is a hope and a conviction that
attaches itself to the things which pass. Why, Belloc asks
time and again, does the fatherland come home to us most
poignantly when we are moved by the presence of mortality?
Why should the symbol of the everlasting both
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
partake of the blessedness it promises and attest thereby
to its own temporal destiny?</p>

<p>A man goes into an ancient inn hidden in the hills of
South England. His soul receives a benediction and he is
at peace. He finds peace <i>there</i>, Belloc continually insists.
This is not the device of a litterateur. It is a reality which
carries along its own inexorable insufficiency. Man feeds
on being, and the being he feeds on fills him with longing.
He is nourished for a little while, only to hunger again.</p>

<p>“The Sign of the Lion,” an essay rich in grave solemnity,
is given over to a consideration of this perennial dilemma.
The author, again “Myself,” engages a stranger in conversation.
The two sit before a great fire in the old common
room, and they consider a paradox: why does man try to
make the sign of eternal happiness bear the impossible dignity
it signifies? These two have sought rest in this inn, and
from all sides the mortality of this mirror of immortal peace
floods in on them. They are filled with a somber realism.</p>

<p>Once more, in the essay “Harbour in the North,” a
stranger appears before the author. Belloc has brought his
cutter under a long seawall, and he meets there another
small vessel. The pilot of this ship declares that he is off
to find a permanent refuge to the north in a harbour of
whose fame he has heard.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... Then he went on with eagerness, though still talking low:
“The voyage which I was born to make in the end, and to
which my desire has driven me, is towards a place in which
everything we have known is forgotten, except those things
which, as we know them, reminded us of an original joy. In
that place I shall discover again such full moments of content
as I have known, and I shall preserve them without failing.”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14">[14]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The seaman’s stores were laid on board, and he was determined
that “he should set sail before morning and reach
at last a complete repose.” Belloc answers him from his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
own boat—the Ship of Mortality: “You cannot make the
harbour.... It is not of this world.”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15">[15]</a></p>

<p>Man is unified in his own being. He is at one with the
good things of this world—his habitation. But he is a
creature of soul as well as body, and this world is at once
a half promise of an eternal destiny and an image of human
mortality. Such are the two <i>natural</i> elements of the Bellocian
vision, and they define felicitously the best in classical
humanism: an acceptance of human nature and of its
home, and a realist understanding of the limits of finite
perfection. Belloc is earth-rooted, and this renders him
happy and melancholy by turns. It is the fate of every
humanist, and it is not difficult to see why Belloc suggests
Samuel Johnson. Johnson was not a mystic but a humanist,
and he is therefore what seems to some a curious mixture
of idealism and realism, virtue and cynicism, faith and
skepticism. So too with Belloc.</p>

<p>Significantly enough, Johnson has been linked with both
halves of the Chester-Belloc. Johnson and Chesterton are
linked together through their striking Englishness; abstracted,
careless in dress, gigantic, they both call to mind
the London of Fleet Street. But for all his associations with
London, Belloc remains either the man of Paris or the man
of the hills of South England. His love of nature and his
affinities with life lived close to the soil and the sea provide
the key to understanding the differences between the
Bellocian and the Chestertonian vision. The two comrades
fought together for years for the same truths, but it would
be naive to assume that they both saw these truths in the
same way. Chesterton was pre-eminently a speculative
thinker, but he invested his thoughts with all the warmth
and cockney glamour of the gas-lit and fog-filled London
he loved. He went through life more abstracted from things
than engaged with them, and he took whatever was at hand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
without reflection: if he drank great quantities of wine,
he also drank deeply of water, if water were put before
him. But when Chesterton shook himself out of his reveries
and gazed on reality, then miracles happened. Romance
is always something brought to a thing, and Chesterton invested
the whole world with the great goodness of his
heart. Chesterton in contact with a <i>thing</i>, be it a lamppost
or an umbrella, was like the fuse that ignites a Roman
candle. Anything at all set his intelligence off on a brilliant
fireworks of paradoxes that penetrated into the heart of
reality. He was a symbolist, and the inner meaning of
creatures was never hidden from his concentration. This
world diaphanously let through the glories of another
order, and Chesterton could see God in a gable. If his world
looks like a pasteboard toy theatre created by a father for
the sheer joy of his children, Chesterton could demonstrate
that the analogy was strictly true. If the toy was out of
order and deranged, the contrast fingered more sharply
than ever the primeval origin of the world in goodness.</p>

<p>Chesterton’s vision was metaphysical, as Mr. Hugh
Kenner has suggested;<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16">[16]</a> broadly speaking, it was mystical
as well. The same cannot be said of Belloc. His vision is
more poetic than metaphysical. On one level almost a
rationalist, on another level—the level that finds him communicating
with the world in which he exists—he is profoundly
tender and awed before the loveliness of creation.
It is the mark of a philosopher that he can see significance
apart from the symbol, whereas it is characteristic of the
poet to cling fast to the concrete structure of his intuition.
Belloc is too much in love with things to use them as
stepping-stones to eternity. He sees eternity in their very
passing, and this is the root of the much-misunderstood
Bellocian irony. Throughout most of his better essays and
in his masterpieces such as <i>The Path to Rome</i> and <i>Hills
and the Sea</i> one can sense an awesomeness and love of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
finite beauty that reveals itself in a style chaste and unadorned
in its expression of tenderness and reverence before
the things which are. Belloc drank at the sources of great
rivers. He worshipped the tides.</p>

<p>Belloc saw things, but Chesterton saw through them.
This is not to say that one is greater than the other, but it
is to declare their fundamental difference.</p>

<p>Belloc’s close union with the passing universe heightens
the great classical humanist dilemma that underlies all his
thought: man is threatened by death. Like everything genuinely
classical, this is a universally human paradox. The
more fully does man achieve his earthly destiny and bring
to a certain pitch of perfection and actuality the possibilities
originally latent within him, the more fully is he aware
of the irony of temporal existence. From this follows the
perennial preoccupation with the passing of beauty and
the inevitability of death. Genuinely Roman, the vigour
and the iron ring of the Bellocian affirmations are tempered
in a lyricism before the <i>lacrimae rerum</i>, and are frequently
mellowed in somber meditation on the great fact of death.</p>

<p>In his biographies, Belloc brings to the famous death
scenes of history a heightened sensibility born of that prolonged
consideration. Read of the execution of Danton
written in the fires of early youth; of the murder of King
Charles I of England; of the conversion of the second
Charles on the point of death. Read in <i>Elizabethan Commentary</i>,
one of his final books, that passage in which he
attempts to guess at the heart of his subject, and, in so doing,
reveals himself: “She felt that she was ceasing to be
herself and that is what probably most of us will feel when
the moment comes to reply to the summons of Azrael.”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17">[17]</a></p>

<p>A brooding sense of inevitable personal death, prefigured
by the passing of friends and the advance of age, haunts a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
great deal of his writing, and invests it with a solemn
majesty that recalls again the great Doctor Johnson, a
humanist who faced the end with bleak courage and somber
faith. There is an essay in Belloc’s <i>Towns of Destiny</i>
titled “Cornetto, of the Tarquins” in which his emotional
skepticism emerges into light in an almost pure state. Speaking
of those tombs which are of the origins of us all, Belloc
makes us aware of the “subterranean vision of death, the
dusk of religion, which they imposed on Rome and from
which we all inherit.”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18">[18]</a> Humanism, even Christian humanism,
must pay a price for its achievement of the earthly
home, and that price, frequently enough, is the temptation
to skepticism. “Then I thought to myself, as I looked westward
from the wall, how man might say of the life of all
our race as of the life of one, that we know not whence it
came, nor whither it goes.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19">[19]</a></p>

<p>The bourgeois world has romanticized death so that it
can escape facing that most monstrous of indignities. Belloc,
on the contrary, views death steadily as the threat to his
humanity which must be explained without being explained
away. The final destruction of that precious crucible of human
existence, the individual personality, cannot be thought
without contradiction. Everything in man is a drive toward
being. If he is sane, man aims at becoming more and more
himself, and to break the human fabric is to betray humanity
itself. The Dead do not die, cries the old Roman in
Belloc. But what can testify to this inner conviction when
the senses themselves seem to mock the exigency of human
nature for survival? Man ought to continue to be, but all
man can see is the passing of things in the eternal rhythm
of generation and corruption.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that Hilaire Belloc was temperamentally
a skeptic, at least throughout a good part of his
career. It is a skepticism which follows on his classical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
humanism. To be integrated in earthly existence is to conceive
both the possibility of an eternal destiny and the
threat of the opposite. To be at home in this world is to
recognize the composite nature of man. The human soul
is not a Platonic idea, but the act of a body rendered human
by its union with the soul. To be fully aware of this, and
only the man who attends to the reality of the earthly part
of himself is so aware, is to experience a <i>sense</i> of annihilation
before the inevitability of death. This is not philosophy,
but it is an attitude which is unmistakably human.
If to be myself is to be fully a man, then when I cease to
be a man at the moment of death, I shall cease to be myself.
Aristotle never got clear of this problem, which can
be called the threat of classical alienation: the final alienation
of man should he cease to be. “Death ... shakes
and rends all that is human in us, creating a monstrous
separation and threatening the soul with isolation which
destroys.”<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20">[20]</a></p>

<p>Final classical alienation, let it be insisted once again,
becomes a more pointed sword the more fully is human
integration achieved. Since alienation is never affirmed, but
is emotionally grasped as a possibility along with the hope
for personal immortality, classical man feels no sense of
guilt simply in being himself. If he is alienated in the end,
it will be too late for guilt. Temporal classical guilt results
from man’s ceasing to be what he can be, and this defines
the nature of tragedy. Modern alienation, on the contrary,
is an alienation existing within a man who can be himself
only on condition that he is alienated. Hence he is aware
of guilt as the quasi-specific difference defining his existence.
He is almost ashamed to be.</p>

<p>Classical humanism is basically insufficient, since man
cannot achieve, of himself, the fullness of his dignity.
Threatened from without by death, the humanist’s integrity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
is attacked from within by the wounds of sin that
divide him from himself. Belloc never romanticized man,
and he is so conscious of the <i>fact</i> of sin that his historical
judgments frequently seem cynical. In a short story called
“The Opportunity,” he writes of three men that “each of
these ... being a man, had a worm at his heart, eating it
out.”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21">[21]</a>
Courage excepted, the classical European humanist
has no natural weapons with which to answer the final
questions.</p>

<p>The humanist cannot escape into the mystical nihilism
that has so fascinated the Eastern World, because his initial
choice has been an election for all human values. Romantic
irrationality, be it aesthetic, political, or naturalistic, is an
insult to his reason. His world outlook is grounded in the
being of the world accepted in its fullness, and in the
achievement of his own being through his affirmation of
the world in which he exists. He cannot, without betraying
the light which has been given him, join the oriental
drive to the beyond. He has too much respect for <i>who</i> he
is, and for <i>where</i> he is. Only faith, a Faith that confirms
and sanctifies the foundations he has built, and a Faith that
fills with reality his hunger for an eternal destiny, can guarantee
his fundamental vision: personal perfection and the
happiness that issues therefrom. The classical humanist,
the old European, sees the gigantic hoax contained in all
the pantheisms and nihilisms that have come riding out of
the deserts to assault the citadel he has built. They offer
everything to man, provided he destroy himself in the
darkness of a mysticism or a philosophy that is at bottom
hollow with atheism and nothingness. The only immortality
worth having is one that is personal and that unites
man with a Personal God who can bestow happiness on
the creature of His Image. Man is, and only He Who Is
can slake his thirst.</p>

<p><i>The Path to Rome: Christian Integration</i></p>

<p>The Catholic Faith came to Hilaire Belloc from his birth
to answer this humanist dilemma. Yet Faith came to him
hard, and precisely because it did his final Christian affirmation
has about it the resounding ring of iron: the iron
which is the adherence of the will to a God unseen. If
Belloc ever had what are called “religious experiences,” or
supernatural “consolations” to aid him on his pilgrimage,
he has kept them sedulously to himself. He seems to appear,
the more closely he is read, as almost an archetype of
skepticism conquered.</p>

<p>There is a passage in <i>The Path to Rome</i> that would lead
one to think this born Catholic went through a severe
siege of skepticism during the confused time of youth.
Years later, in at least two published works, he hinted at
something approaching a reconversion in which he awoke
to a more fully articulated understanding of Catholicism.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the first place I was baptized into the Faith upon my birth,
and have known it all my life.... Next, I have, though baptized
into it and familiar with it from my earliest years, in some
sense also discovered the Faith—but this I will not pursue as it
is somewhat intimate, and hardly to the point; unless, indeed,
it be to the point to tell those who read me and who are balancing,
that I also have balanced.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22">[22]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The same sentiment, once again guarded in reticence, is
made in an essay written on the death of Chesterton.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I was not when I first met him as alive to the strength of that
word “Catholic” as I am today; I myself have gone through a
pilgrimage of approach, to an understanding in the matter....
Having said so much ... I will leave it, for it is too personal
and has been too prolonged.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23">[23]</a></p>
</div>

<p>To a generation accustomed to the depiction of the psychology
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
of grace, the personal reserve of the man, prolonged
through a life devoted to religious controversy, is
bound to be curious if not somewhat irritating. He reveals
almost everything but the inner spiritual crisis. He apparently
felt it was no one’s business but his own. Nothing
could be more typically Bellocian.</p>

<p>The Catholic Church appears in Belloc’s thought, as
given us in his writing, as the custodian of the Faith—of a
Faith beyond himself, objective, out there, demanding acceptance
because it is the Truth. Emotional skepticism is
disciplined by a reason that must affirm that which is.
Christ came, claimed to be Divine, died, and came back in
three days from the dead. Such is the evidence, and it is
ultimately traceable, through tradition and written testimony,
to the Apostles who saw it with their own eyes.
Faith is not established, as such, by personal experience nor
by private speculations, but on an evidence which is a
heritage common to all mankind. Emotion may aid or may
block faith, but the act of faith itself is eminently reasonable,
and it is the business of the will to rectify reason and
not permit it to be swamped in the vagaries of subjectivism.
Belloc’s approach is by no means the only approach to religion,
but it is one that is cold, hard, rational; the insight
of a man with an intellect which is French in its incisiveness,
directness, and confidence in itself. Such a faith is
unbolstered by any natural religiosity, but for that very
reason it presents a hard, diamond-like character, unyielding
and dogmatic in its affirmations: a faith foreign to
fashions, be they literary or philosophical.</p>

<p>In a letter written to Chesterton upon the occasion of the
latter’s entrance into the Church, Belloc compares the man
of Faith to a man who walks through the rain at night, and
who feels in his bones that he has gone thirty miles, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
who knows well enough from his map and his reason that
he has not travelled eleven.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am by all my nature of mind skeptical.... And as to the
doubt of the soul I discover it to be false: a mood, not a conclusion.
My conclusion—and that of all men who have ever once
<i>seen</i> it—is the Faith: Corporate, organized, a personality,
teaching. A thing, not a theory. It.</p>

<p>To you, who have the blessing of profound religious emotion,
this statement may seem too desiccate.... It is my misfortune.
In youth I had it: even till lately. Grief has drawn the juices
from it. I am alone, and unfed, the more do I affirm the Sanctity,
the Unity, the Infallibility of the Catholic Church. By my very
isolation do I the more affirm it.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24">[24]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The early death of his wife whom he worshipped, the
death of a son in World War I and then again of a son in
World War II, the ever present and never fully overcome
threat of personal poverty, the passing of the friends of
youth, the dire fulfillment of his political and economic
warnings which went unheeded, the apparent dryness of
his religious life—all these tragedies struck his heart and
isolated him from family, friends, political life, society,
from joy. He never speaks of these things in his public
writings, but they add to his integrated Catholic personality
the steel of great character. He maintained himself in
a desert.</p>

<p>From the very outset of his career, the Catholic center
of Belloc’s life appears as the spiritual hub from whence
proceed the amazingly diverse spokes of his personality.
The Faith is never glimpsed as a hope in the distance that
calls him out of the secularist age in which he lived. The
Faith is always present, informing and energizing his being,
disciplining his irony, conquering his skepticism, and giving
direction to his destiny. Nevertheless, a close reading of
the Bellocian corpus reveals a shift in religious emphasis
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
as the man advanced in years. In the earlier books, the
humanizing role of Catholicism is the dominant motif: the
Church is that corporate organism, Divine in origin, that
alone accounts for the high culture of the older European
civilization. She is the custodian of personal dignity, the
ancient mistress that alone of all societies can harbour the
human spirit and nourish it into its fullness. Through her,
God offers temporal dignity and eternal salvation to man.
But as Belloc grew older he sounded a new religious emphasis
as he plunged more deeply into directly apologetic
and controversial battle. Although the reality of Christian
humanism is never forgotten, the Church emerges in his
writing not only as the Divine instrument of human salvation,
but more and more as the Truth of God, to which
everything personal must be sacrificed, should events dictate
such a course.</p>

<p>Belloc saw with unerring accuracy that the bulk of what
he called “official history” in the English-speaking world
was anti-Catholic. He attacked the thing bitterly, brilliantly,
and at great cost to his reputation. He saw that the
individualist, industrial, capitalist society of England was
anti-human to the core. He attacked it. He grasped the
anti-Christian meaning of Prussia, and he fought against
this spirit from the North of Germany with intense vigour.
He analyzed the anti-intellectual and therefore anti-Catholic
bias that moved the “Modern Mind” in the bewildering
complexity of that mind’s activities. He detested the
<i>Zeitgeist</i> which had surrendered the best man had: his
power to reason, judge, and affirm; therefore it had lost
the one sure road it had of discovering the Truth of God.
Belloc became committed—the French artilleryman in the
service of the Church. His intransigence rendered him a
marked man. Shaw wondered why Belloc should waste
his profuse talents in the service of the Bishop of Rome.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
Wells noted critically his “partisan fanaticism.” Some Catholic
academicians, to gain for themselves the reputation of
impartial scholarship and save their standing in the world
of learning, disavowed him.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that Belloc entered into battle with
his eyes open. If he was anything at all, he was a realist: he
understood men and the motives that move them; he was
aware of the doors opening to political and literary preferment.
His brilliance was such that he could have risen to
a Cabinet post through the Liberal Party. He could have
carved out for himself an exclusively literary reputation,
possibly as great as Conrad’s. He could have become the
recognized first historian in the Empire. He sacrificed it
all and placed his sword at the service of the Church. It
has been suggested that the decisive turning point in his
career occurred when he delivered a fighting speech before
Archbishop Bearne against the Liberal Government’s intention
to prohibit a Eucharistic procession through the streets
of London.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25">[25]</a> At that time Belloc was a Liberal Member of
Parliament, and the Tories thought that he would turn to
them after his break with his own party. His political principles
would not permit such a sellout. He went up to the
platform a public figure, and came down an Apostle. “I
begin to think this intimate religion as tragic as a great
love ... as tragic as first love, and (it) drags us out into
the void away from our dear homes.”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26">[26]</a></p>

<p>Belloc’s career as an apologist exemplifies the first paradox
inherent in Christian humanism. Only the Incarnation
can make man whole, but as the Incarnation issues into
Calvary, so too must the whole man sacrifice himself to the
service of the God-Man. The ascent of man to God is impossible
without the prior descent of God to man, and
the two meet at the Cross. Once this truth is lived, then
the second paradox of Christian humanism can follow. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
man who has given himself is paid back with his own gift:
himself transfigured in the Divine Fires.</p>

<p>Belloc became himself in controversy. He warmed to
the battle entered into freely, and his personality expanded
before the prospect of facing all official England arraigned
against him. It was a time in which things Catholic were
neither popular with the masses nor fashionable with the
elite. His opposition was enormous. Possibly he could have
gained some concessions to his cause had he compromised;
but Belloc never stooped to conquer. It is small wonder
that Douglas Jerrold called him one of the last men in England
who was, in the full sense of the term, not vulgar.</p>

<p>He became most widely known as a brilliant and somewhat
brutal defender of the Catholic Order. But what
is not so widely known is the fact that Belloc’s vocation
was erected on a delicate structure of human values accepted
in their fullness, disciplined by an understanding
of their limits, and welded into one by Faith. Belloc is not
simply a Michael defending his beloved Church. His partisan
belligerence masks his humanist complexity: he is
really many men—a pagan Roman classicist—an English
naturalist, a French rationalist, a soldier—a Catholic—one
man.</p>

<p>The contrast between pagan humanism—man achieved
on earth, but threatened by death—and Christian humanism—man
achieved forever—can best be grasped by contrasting
<i>The Four Men</i> with the great <i>Path to Rome</i>. In the former
book, Myself finds himself in his companions, but having
found himself he faces the threat of final isolation, the
alienation of death. The somber beauty of the Sussex wood,
the lonely Downs and the pounding of the tides, the time
of autumn, symbolize the threat to the human person who
is just coming into his own. Death is all around him, and
Sussex itself is marked with the inexorable mutability
attaching to a passing world. Although all Four Men are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
Catholics, their religion functions in the foreground,
around the campfire as it were, as hardly more than a
mythology. Immortality is hoped for, but is not affirmed
clearly as a reality. Belloc achieved a brilliant artistic success
in painting the dilemma of the ancient pagan, and the
dilemma of every man, in a framework which is, on the
surface, both Catholic and contemporary. He was able to
do this because he remained throughout his life, on one
level of his personality, the threatened Myself.</p>

<p><i>The Path to Rome</i>, on the contrary, is most particularly
the book of a Catholic man at home in Christendom. Man
is in no sense alienated. Myself (here openly the author) is
a member of the Church Militant, destined for the Church
Triumphant. Belloc tramps through the Alps, down into
the broad Italian plains, and his heart expands under the
graciousness of Catholic skies. An abounding good humour
flows into every event, conferring on the most trivial encounter
the character of high adventure. Here is the picture
of a man who has fought the battle for Faith, and who has
been granted some share of peace. He still ponders the
nature of the soul. A man so at home with mountains, good
wine, and the laughter of friends will never approach the
supernatural with the confidence of a contemplative. Belloc’s
delight is with the old Europe he loves so deeply,
and if there be ecstasies beyond what he can see, he will
“take them upon trust and see whether they could make
the matter clearer in Rome.”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27">[27]</a> The irony of this essentially
somber spirit is relieved by a humour that is thoroughly
Catholic in its simplicity.</p>

<p>This best of all travel books is vintage Belloc because it
displays him in all the rich diverseness of his centralized
personality. His grave mood, his Grizzlebeard, is constantly
balanced by his robust vitality, by the Rabelaisian flavour
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
of this latter-day Villon. He relishes existence with a
zest that does due honour to the gifts of God; he laughs;
he pontificates with mock solemnity; he trifles brilliantly
with words (see the business about “windows”); he
holds forth on the nature of Fools; and then he breaks into
some of the loveliest lyrical prose in all English letters. And
through all this adventuring and tramping runs a sanity
that is almost more than human. If great beauty be the
“common transfigured,” as Belloc holds it to be, then this
record of a shanksmare hike to Rome shall ever stand as a
symbol of what man can be if he will only cease being
other than himself.</p>

<p>The universe as seen by Hilaire Belloc in <i>The Path to
Rome</i>, <i>Hills and the Sea</i>, and <i>The Cruise of the Nona</i> is a
thoroughly Catholic universe: physical nature is grasped
as good in its very being, and to this inner worthiness of all
things there has been added the sacramental seal of the
power of God. One can almost see the Papal blessing <i>Urbi
et Orbi</i>, hanging like a benediction over the vineyards and
hills of Italy as they embrace the man coming down from
the cold heights of the Alps.</p>

<p>One can describe the Bellocian world no better than by
saying that it is the total opposite of the world of Brunner,
Barth, Kafka, and Kierkegaard. If Belloc’s way of looking
at things seems so strangely foreign when compared with
the outlook of the contemporary intelligentsia, it is because
the former is Catholic and the latter is lapsed-Catholic.
The philosophy of the modern European is, as Edith Stein
once said, “the philosophy of a lapsed-Catholic with a bad
conscience.” If Belloc sees the supernatural order as completely
penetrating the natural order, it is because grace
is seen as not destroying a nature essentially corrupted in
sin, but as operating within man and flowering in his very
gestures.</p>

<p>Dozens of times throughout his essays, Belloc’s Catholic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
insight comes home to the reader, not as something superimposed
nor as something articulated conceptually, but as
the very intelligibility of the man’s work. He saw reality as
a gift to be greeted and revered. There is nothing of the
contemporary irritation with existence in Belloc. He
is never shocked by being. He does not stumble guiltily
through a world of spikes, hedged in by the sharp outline
of nothingness. Human hypocrisy, greed, social injustice,
the loss of economic and personal freedom, the pride of
the rich: these sins arouse his ire and bring forth the great
thunder of his hammer-like denunciations. But being has
not sinned. It is the innocent one recalling all of us to the
morning of the race, and to the promise of paradise regained.
“If someone find a beautiful thing, whether done
by God or by man, he will remember and love it. This is
what children do, and to get the heart of a child is the end
surely of any act of religion.”<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28">[28]</a></p>

<p>If we would seek one symbol that best crystallizes the
Bellocian affirmation, we would find it in wine. Belloc,
tramping over the lands of Barbary, brooded long on the
lost vineyards as he saw nothing but the vacancy of the
desert. He turned and went back to that Europe he so
loved, and he drank wine to her in his heart.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29">[29]</a> Wine called
forth for him the Sacrament of the Altar and that one moment
in time when a passing world full of passing men was
lifted out of the darkness. The mystical figure of wine
seemed to him to sum up the Catholic affirmations, even to
the heart of the Mysteries of the Faith.</p>

<p>The Bellocian vision, while poetic and religious, finds its
completion in history. Belloc’s grasp of the European past
was something amazing, and it grew out of the need his
personality felt for total integration. Man would remain
starved if he did not make his past his own. In Belloc the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
ages became one. As the Church is something visible, existing
in space, and enduring in time, so also is the world that
she has created something physical to be seen and handled
like a Thing: something that perpetuates itself against mortality
through a tradition that stretches back into the mists
of antiquity.</p>

<p>A man’s understanding of himself depends on where he
steps into history; not mere academic nor <i>written</i> and catalogued
information, but the past as assimilated into a personality,
and as taking on the very existence of a man.
When Belloc writes history he is one with the march of
the West. Whatever was divisive of the unity of Christendom,
even if dead and long conquered, receives at his hands
a hatred that is almost personal. Belloc the soldier haunted
the battlefields of the First Crusade, marked with his fingers
the high point of the Mohammedan wave, and went with
Napoleon into the Russian winter. He said once of a friend
that “history had overlapped on him.” He was describing
himself.</p>

<p>All this does not make for dispassionate scholarship, but
it makes for something vastly more important: it situates a
man squarely in the path of history, and it renders him conscious
of all that has gone before to make him what he is.
He becomes himself twice over. What contemporary writer
speaks of the time when “we broke the back of Islam at
Tours”?</p>

<p>Spiritual insight into the destiny of Christendom, added
to an imagination that could vividly resurrect the past, were
tools that rendered Belloc uniquely capable of presenting
the drama of Europe to an age that largely had
ceased living by the old Faith. But above their value in
furthering his Christian vocation, they added to his theocentric
humanism further integration. The person who is
unified in himself and in society through Faith is further
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
enriched if he <i>is</i>, in a sense, all that has gone before. It was
Belloc’s good fortune that there was enough of the older
Christendom physically in being for him to see at first hand.
His historical perspective is uniquely realistic. He frequently
deplored historical investigation that proceeded
exclusively through written testimony. Such history is
lacking in two things: the past is not brought back to us
with sufficient vigour and colour, and the past loses its
personal, human, integrative value, because history must be
seen in <i>things</i> which now exist because of that which has
existed.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>History, therefore, once a man has begun to know it, becomes
a necessary food for the mind, without which it cannot sustain
its new dimension.... But history, if it is to be kept just and
true ... must be continually corrected and moderated by the
seeing and handling of <i>things</i>.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30">[30]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Belloc’s intensive preoccupation with Christendom is
an interest not in a concept, nor in an abstracted framework
nor an academic “problematic”; it is an engagement
in an historical reality, to be <i>seen</i> and understood on the
spot. Occasionally, as he stands in some place hallowed by
past significance, he seems almost burdened by the grandeur
of the task. See how he writes of the fascination of pursuing
the Roman Road between Winchester and Canterbury:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For my part I desired to step exactly in the footprints of such
ancestors. I believed that, as I followed their hesitations at the
river-crossings, as I climbed where they had climbed to a shrine
whence they also had seen a wide plain, as I suffered the fatigue
they suffered, and laboriously chose, as they had chosen, the
proper soils for going, something of their much keener life
would wake again in the blood I drew from them, and that in a
sort I should forget the vileness of my own time, and renew for
some few days the better freedom of that vigorous morning
when men were already erect, articulate, and worshipping God,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
but not yet broken by complexity and the long accumulation
of evil.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31">[31]</a></p>
</div>

<p>What he is proposing here and what he urges constantly
is an historical recovery of the self, so that spiritual isolation
will not claim the soul.</p>

<p>If modern man is isolated, and who can doubt that he is,
his isolation stems from a variety of causes, some of which
have been briefly indicated. Among others is the almost
total loss of not only the reality of tradition, but of the
sense of tradition, in industrial man. By industrial man, of
course, one indicates not simply the man engaged in factory
production. By industrial man one means that mechanical
personality who has been fashioned by the age—a wound
that few if any of us have escaped.</p>

<p>Without a steady tradition enduring through the passage
of generations a man lives insecurely in a present which
constantly ceases to be. The drive of his being towards an
eternal destiny necessitates his finding an analogue of
eternity. Without this, man is without moorings; he drifts
and is alone; he is obscurely guilty of lacking something
demanded by his nature. Without tradition, he is a victim
offered daily to the cruelties of the moment.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Man has a body as well as a soul, and the whole of man, soul
and body, is nourished sanely by a multiplicity of observed
traditional things.... Not only death ... but that accompaniment
of mortality which is a perpetual series of lesser deaths
and is called change, is challenged, chained, and put in its place
by unaltered and successive acts of seasonable regard for loss
and dereliction and mutability ... the perils of sickness in the
body and even in the mind, anxiety, honour harassed, all the
bitterness of living—become part of a large business which may
lead to Beatitude. For they are all connected in the memory
with holy day after holy day, year by year, binding the generations
together; carrying on even in this world, as it were, the
life of the dead and giving corporate substance, permanence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
and stability, without the symbol of which (at least) the vast
increasing burden of life might at last conquer us and be no
longer borne.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32">[32]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Man’s past has never been better known than it is today.
Yet this knowledge is almost exclusively academic. It is
encased in the great libraries of the civilized world, and
it exists divisively in the minds of countless scholars. But
it is no longer known <i>as a whole</i> that translates itself into
the life of the community. In ceasing to be a tradition, the
great story of the West has died; for the only existence
the past can possibly have in a culture is traditional. A
tradition is measured in a society by that society’s consciousness
of its own <i>symbols</i>, which render the tradition
present to men. Contemporary industrial society has burgeoned
within what was once Christendom, but having lost
the old Faith, it has lost the old symbols, which now hang
on precariously as <i>myths</i> and forms emptied of content.
Industrial man has no tradition of his own to incarnate in
song and stone, in the gestures of daily living. He has
nothing to recall. As a result contemporary man is ruled
largely by wayward myths that appeal to his subconscious
drives. Political slogans, ideals gleaned from mass entertainment
and ephemeral advertising dominate his urges,
and create his conscious desires. Cinema heroes and contest
winners give him an ever shifting hagiography in
which nothing is so dead as yesterday’s idol or this morning’s
news. Even the library that houses last week’s paper
is called “the morgue.”</p>

<p>A society without a self-conscious tradition takes to
worshipping the future. It adores that which has not been,
and that which never is. If Shaw was a satirical mirror of
the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, his friend
Wells was its prophet. It is through Wells that the man of
the twenty-fifth century came into his own. And Wells’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
most articulate critic in those days, throughout the whole
of England, was Hilaire Belloc. Today Belloc’s long battle
against this drive away from our origins, his long fight to
make the West conscious and proud of its past, has been
partially vindicated, ironically enough, in our own generation.
After World War II, with the threat of the atomic
age, the prophets of the future have turned into prophets
of doom. When thinking man looks ahead he does not see
the age of superman, but the grim world of Big Brother
and the phantasies of George Orwell. The future, if the
present be not altered by a radical reaction, can only effect
a “Servile State” which would be even more inhuman and
barbarous than the coming society envisaged by Belloc
when he first penned that now famous term in 1908.</p>
<p>Belloc had no doubts about the great Western Catholic
tradition. He was absolutely convinced of its superiority—a
superiority that extended to the economic and political
orders as well as to the theological. Belloc was cavalier in
the way he flung the reality of European Christendom at
his contemporaries. He was constantly saying to them: look
at that, you fools, what have you to offer? To achieve success
in such an endeavour Belloc had to act the way he did—rough,
brutally dogmatic, sweeping in his argument.
Muted tones and footnote scholarship can gain skirmishes
within the classrooms and the scholarly journals; they have
never yet won a large-scale battle. Belloc faced a generation
of English journalist-politician intellectuals who
looked expectantly to a future grounded on the Whig-Liberal
industrialist myth. These were men consciously
convinced of the inevitability and the justness of almost
every aspect of modern civilization. Belloc swept their case
away in book after book, and if the myth of Nordic supremacy
is discredited today, if the Catholic ethos and
past has something of a hearing in the English-speaking
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
world of our generation, if industrial capitalism is no longer
thought to be as natural as the air we breathe and if it is
no longer seen as the only alternative to Communism, if the
first fifteen centuries of the British Isles are not automatically
dismissed by the educated—if the air has changed,
it is due in no small measure to that long cavalry charge of
Hilaire Belloc, prolonged through fifty years of warfare
against what he tersely called “the Barbarians.”</p>

<p>A full description of his battle belongs more to a consideration
of the man as an historian and as a sociologist.
What is to the point here is that what Belloc did grew
out of what he was. His heartiness and confidence, his
good conscience, sprang from what he <i>knew</i> and what he
had <i>seen</i>. Christendom was something almost physical to
him. He assimilated his own past in the most concrete
way open to him. He tramped all over Western Europe;
he ate much and drank deeply in half-forgotten inns that
for him always symbolized roots and freedom; he sailed
along the coast of England and charted the landing of the
first Normans; he followed the route of the Phoenicians;
he knelt before the site of Calvary as an old man. With
an iron determination, he willed to become one with all
that had gone to make him what he was—a Western Catholic
man. In his own home in Sussex he kept alive all the
older traditions of the countryside.</p>

<p>It has been said frequently that Belloc remained a
stranger in England. Las Vergnas understood him almost
exclusively as a Frenchman. He was neither a Frenchman
nor an Englishman; he was both of them, and he was more
than either of them. In his essays Belloc is a South English
peasant and a channel sailor. In his political sympathies, he
is an English Monarchist and a French Republican. In the
soldierly dimension of himself he is thoroughly Gallic. In
his over-all vision, he belongs to the old Roman Empire
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
and to Christendom. He combines within his personality a
complexity of cultural and spiritual strains which are never
bastardized in any specious internationalism, but which
retain their individualities by being welded into an analogous
unity by his Catholicism. His was a precarious but
happy balance that included the main lines of his blood
past and his spiritual antecedents.</p>

<p>If Belloc’s over-all historical and cultural perspective is
a sweeping thing that encompasses the centuries, it must be
remembered that this central principle of historical organization
was balanced by a vivid sense of the immediate drama
of things past and present. One of the most revealing characteristics
of the Bellocian humanism is its lack of academicism—one
might almost say its anti-academicism. Belloc
is always out on the road with his senses peeled. This psychological
fact points up a union of two drives in man
which are rarely in harmony with each other: a self-conscious
emphasis on the past, and a communion with the
physical universe which actually exists.</p>

<p>Traditionalism, when it is espoused by an intelligentsia,
frequently suffers from an overdeveloped symbolism.
Things are not seen in themselves. They are seen only as
symbols. The now is important only to illuminate the past,
or to call to mind spiritual and moral values. The purely
symbolic always tends to eliminate the concrete, the individual,
the existent; it leads the mind through the phenomenal
to an eternal which is frequently nothing more
than the dust of an abstraction. Several of the great
Eastern traditional cultures have atrophied through an
overdevelopment of this kind of symbol and mythmaking.
Byzantine iconography suffers from it, and insofar as it
does, it is not of the West. Carried to the end in the moral
order, pure symbolism means that nothing is valued or
loved for itself. Philosophically considered, such a traditionalism
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
is a kind of Platonism in which the world functions
only to manifest historical myths or systems of ideas.
If the masses today suffer from a lack of conscious religious,
social and historical symbols, the intellectual suffers from
the contrary: he turns everything solid into a mirror. Intellectually
this ends in a simple inability to see things as
they are. Theologically, it would appear to be a kind of
subtle Manicheanism, in which nothing is good enough
as it is.</p>

<p>Belloc constantly kept himself engaged with things.
His understanding of the Catholic tradition escapes the
purely symbolic and academic order. What he sees in the
river valleys and inns of Europe <i>is</i> symbolic of a great historical
effort stamped with the City of God; but what is
so stamped is good in itself. If you would understand the
past that has made you and grasp something of the spirit
of its religion, Belloc urges that you go to Arles, for example;
but above all, <i>see</i> Arles. Belloc’s Grizzlebeard, the
custodian of tradition, is one with his Sailor, the man of
“the five senses.”</p>

<p>If his Grizzlebeard were without a Sailor, Belloc’s traditionalism
would have stiffened into something Egyptian,
mummified. But since he is of the West himself, of an order
which has been eminently practical and concrete as well
as visionary, these two remain one. To exemplify the nature
of tradition, Belloc finds his best instance to be a seaman’s
knot.</p>

<p>If his Sailor had had no Grizzlebeard, then Belloc’s concrete
vision and communion with reality would have degenerated
into a kind of irrational naturalism. Naturalism is
merely an escape into the physical universe, away from
burdens which are peculiarly human. It is one of the less
healthy offshoots of the fertile tree of Romanticism. Since
no man can just wallow in nature for long without reacting
in some way, the pure Romantic soon comes up with
a view of nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
as an irrational force within whose bosom
is to be found salvation. The spectacle of D. H. Lawrence
comes to mind immediately. The humanist reacts to nature
by taming the beast; the Christian humanist tames a Good
Beast. But the romantic naturalist attunes himself to the
wilderness and finally renounces his social nature. The
eighteenth-century City of Man appeared to the early
Romantics to be an utter sham. The Age of Reason had run
its course, and the intellect had become an intolerable
burden. The Romantics tried to escape from their humanity
into a physical beyond; having surrendered the reason,
they gave themselves up to mythmaking. Mr. Auden has
analyzed the peculiar significance of the “sea” and the
“desert” for European Romanticism.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33">[33]</a> The “sea” represented
the infinite possibilities that urged human nature
to break its bond. But this optimism carried within itself
the seeds of a subsequent despair. The “desert” represented
the possibilities exhausted, the sea dried up. The
surrender of the reason and of the corporate wisdom
of society ended in giving the spirit over to darkness. The
older traditions reminiscent of the Catholic Unity were
jettisoned, and the result is known to us all. The <i>Walpurgisnacht</i>
orgies under Nazism bore bitter fruit in a cult of
blood and soil that just missed wiping out the remnants
of Western Christian Europe.</p>

<p>Western man for centuries now has lost the key to his
own meaning. He has been striving for a long time to break
out of the ruins of a City half destroyed at his own hands.
Political Liberalism of the old-fashioned Marxian variety
grew out of a psychological desire to get away from where
man actually found himself. Post-World War II existentialist
despair, considered as a socio-historical reality, is a
philosophical justification for this urge to break all existing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
cultural and historical limits. What must be done, at all
costs, is to exorcise our common historical heritage, our
faith, our corporate memories. A fresh beginning can be
the only beginning. This is a presupposition that is operative
everywhere, most concretely in the arts, most consciously
in philosophy, and most dangerously in religion.</p>

<p>Such is the estrangement modern man has carved for
himself. In social and economic life the masses are estranged
from their spiritual and cultural past. Politically, techniques
forged by Western man himself have alienated him from
his ancient freedom. The home, the nation, the Church,
the West, the past, roots, origins—these are always wrong,
always wicked: only the wilderness of the future promises
salvation. The poet has retreated to that uniquely modern
place invented in the early nineteenth century—the state of
mind called Bohemia. His destiny seems assured when he
has pruned away everything reminiscent of the objective
order, and when he finds himself alone with his broken
soul. Philosophically, the age has had urged on it the clever
monstrosity that since consciousness renders to me what
is Other than Myself, then my personality is defined by a
negation. Theologically, the Barbarian God of the peat
bogs has come back with “neo-orthodoxy,” and man is
told that he is so utterly other than God that he is in no
sense the image of his Creator. The human fabric has been
so cut to ribbons that man has been reduced to a nothing
that can parade his utter absurdity only by putting on a
mask. The clown has come into his own.</p>

<p>Now it is part of the enduring significance of Hilaire
Belloc that he saw all of this long ago. He saw it as the
enemy of all that Christendom had ever built and loved
and believed. He saw it as a unique concentration of evils
that separately, one after another, had attacked the Christian
City since its inception. He nailed the thing to the wall
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
when he called it the spirit of Barbarism: the spirit that
cannot build for itself because it rejects all limit, the essence
of finite perfection; the spirit that makes its way in the
intellectual world and in that necessary parasite, the world
of fashion, by negating all that has gone on before; a spirit
that thrives on opposition and rebellion, and that can
cheaply dismiss as nothing the common effort of three
thousand years.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Barbarian hopes—and that is the very mark of him—that
he can have his cake and eat it too. He will consume what civilization
has slowly produced after generations of selection and
effort, but he will not be at the pains to replace such goods, nor
indeed has he a comprehension of the virtue that has brought
them into being. Discipline seems to him irrational, on which
account he is ever marvelling that civilization should have
offended him with priests and soldiers.</p>

<p>... In a word, the Barbarian is discoverable everywhere in
this, that he cannot <i>make</i>; that he can befog and destroy, but
that he cannot sustain; and of every Barbarian in the decline
or peril of every civilization exactly that has been true.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34">[34]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Belloc is one of the few writers in the English world
of the last fifty years who wanted to remain himself, and
who desired to stand exactly where he was: a Christian
man standing in a tradition whose religion is Catholic and
whose origins are in the Roman Order. Because of this,
Belloc will never be considered an Intellectual. He should
not be so considered. He detested the term. The contemporary
Intellectual of the Western World has come out of
the same past as Belloc, but he rejects that past as he rejects
its religion. That is why the past fifty to seventy-five
years of intellectual life have been fevered with experiment—in
literature, in philosophy, in politics, in all the arts,
and in morals. If some new truth has emerged from it all,
and if some beauty has been etched in the darkness, does
it not seem as nothing to what has been given up?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>Christopher Dawson stated once that the modern soul is
at bottom anti-ontological. It hates being. Hilaire Belloc
has said that the modern soul hates proportion and limitation.
They are both affirming the same truth, because the
condition of all being save God is limitation. Integrated
Christian humanism accepts the finite goodness that constitutes
the nature of man. Out of this affirmation the soul
can build of itself a work of art; without this affirmation,
man gives himself over to the darkness in the suicide of
self-alienation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We sit by and watch the Barbarian, we tolerate him; in the
long stretches of peace we are not afraid.</p>

<p>We are tickled by his irreverence, his comic inversion of our
old certitudes and our fixed creeds refreshes us; we laugh. But
as we laugh we are watched by large and awful faces from
beyond: and on these faces there is no smile.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35">[35]</a></p>
</div>

<p>These faces are masks of that one Evil that has ever
enticed man into the wilderness. Belloc the soldier saw it
riding out of the Eastern wastes, trampling under the vineyards
and desecrating the shrines of Christian men, giving
over the soil to the sands and the mind to an awful simplicity.
He saw it rising within the great Universities
of Europe, rubbing out the certitudes and the songs of
Catholic Men.</p>

<p>His soul too had been wounded by the darkness that surrounds
the spirit and makes for isolation. There is a passage
in <i>Esto Perpetua</i> in which Belloc—once again “Myself”—met
a stranger in Timgad, that African town, once Roman
and fertile, now empty and given back to the desert. They
spoke to one another, and their conversation was the drama
of salvation and damnation. Belloc looked on the desert,
and he was tempted: the soul seemed nothing, and he
thought of those who “see at last that there is no Person in
destiny, and that purpose is only in themselves. Their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
Faiths turn to legend, and at last they enter that shrine
whose God has departed and whose Idol is quite blind.”<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36">[36]</a>
He felt terror and was less a man. But he turned and went
back to the place he had known, and the terror left him,
and he was a man once again.</p>

HISTORY FROM WITHIN</p>
</div>

<p>Among all the disciplines in which Hilaire Belloc has
laboured, history stands out as his most ambitious field of
endeavour. Belloc’s historical <i>practice</i> is too complex to
be judged in any general essay concerning his essential
importance. But his historical <i>theory</i> is crucially important
for fixing the limits of his integrated Christian humanism.
It is as an extension of his humanism that his historical
position will be analyzed.</p>

<p>The cardinal significance of the Bellocian conception of
history is its traditionalism. History is organic; it grows
from within a culture and is the actual cause of that culture’s
corporate existence in present time. Since Christendom
has been rendered one by a religious tradition that
has permeated the diverse dimensions of the past—familial,
regional, and the rest—the past is rendered intelligible by
grasping the inner spirit that has seeded the ground and
watered the growth of historical man. Those who attack
Hilaire Belloc for being biased in his historical perspective
must first settle the question of the very nature of history
itself. For Belloc history begins as an extension of tradition;
history is an act of “self-knowledge,” as he puts it in
his magnificent introduction to <i>Europe and the Faith</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>This act of self-knowledge does not proceed from any
desire to systematize or catalogue facts. It does not proceed
from the need man has for the possession of impersonal,
objective truth. History is the effect of an inner command
to know one’s soul. It is the completion of human consciousness.
The passion for history is man’s Grizzlebeard.
As the Sailor renders Myself unalienated from the physical
universe in which he exists, the Grizzlebeard seals Myself
in time which has stamped man in its own image. Belloc
returns to this theme time and again in the essays, but nowhere
does he express himself more movingly than in <i>The
Old Road</i>, where he tells us why he elected to recover the
Roman Way from Winchester to Canterbury.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To study something of great age until one grows familiar
with it and almost to live in its time, is not merely to satisfy a
curiosity or to establish aimless truths: it is rather a function
whose appetite has always rendered History a necessity. By
the recovery of the Past, stuff and being are added to us; our
lives, which, lived in the present only, are a film or surface, take
on body—are lifted into one dimension more. The soul is fed.
Reverence and knowledge and security and the love of a good
land—all these are increased or given by the pursuit of this kind
of learning. Visions or intimations are confirmed.... One may
say that historical learning grants men glimpses of life completed
and a whole; and such a vision should be the chief solace
of whatever is mortal and cut off imperfectly from fulfillment.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37">[37]</a></p>
</div>

<p>It is well known that the humanist conception of history
as a psychological necessity first came into its own in the
Western World with the Incarnation of the Son of God in
time. In the classical pagan world the status of history was
at best ambiguous. Aristotle gave historical knowledge a
low place in his hierarchy of values. History for the Greek
philosophers could not achieve the dignity of a science
because it lacked the universal necessity without which
there is no science. The philosophers were right in judging
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
history not to be a science. They were wrong in according
history little value. What the wise men of the ancient world
took away from history, the common sense of the people
gave back. The dignity of history was grasped obscurely
because the humanism of the classical universe could not
achieve its fullness unless man was unified in time as well
as in space. The tradition of the family enshrined in the
household gods and in the legend of Aeneas carrying father
Anchises on his back out of burning Troy symbolized a
need rooted in the substance of human nature: the necessity
to link the present with the past. Familial traditions extended
to the City, and then to the Empire, and even the
work of Virgil the Poet was historical in inspiration.</p>

<p>The Incarnation in time and the prolonging of the Deposit
of Faith through the centuries in a living tradition
that hands on what it has received, confirmed the humanist
insight and at the same time conferred on history a dignity
of an altogether new order. No one in the new Christian
society, not even the scientist or philosopher, would ever
more despise history, and if the West has accorded to history
a place unique in the hierarchy of human values, it is
because time had been sanctified and conquered by the
Son of God.</p>

<p>History added to classical man a depth he needed in
order to be himself. The Faith taught Christian man that
nothing is ever lost: the ages themselves live a timeless
and ever fresh life in the Vision of God. Tradition, which
is nothing but the corporate life of the past existing in the
present, is the human analogue of the Eternal Morning
Who is the End of us all.</p>

<p>Historical tradition, to grow as it should, must commence
with that society which is most natural to man: the family.
Familial memory incarnated in a host of rites, observances,
and actions lifts the members of this primordial community
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
out of the impermanence of a present ever passing, and life
is invested with a fullness that the immortal in man demands.
The moment is salvaged, and the suffering and
estrangement forced on humanity by the sheer duty of
living becomes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... part of a large business which may lead to Beatitude....
Not only death (which shakes and rends all that is human in
us, creating a monstrous separation and threatening the soul
with isolation which destroys), not only death, but that accompaniment
of mortality which is a perpetual series of lesser deaths
and is called change, is challenged, chained, and put in its place
by unaltered and successive acts of seasonable regard for loss
and dereliction and mutability.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38">[38]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This immemorial <i>sense</i> for history has always run
through every artery of the corporate life of Christendom,
and in Hilaire Belloc it finds a final champion. Read <i>A
Remaining Christmas</i> or <i>The Mowing of a Field</i> for an insight
into Belloc’s sense of history as tradition. For him,
and here he is one with that past he claimed for himself,
history is simply the recovery of the self: a personal and
communal act of memory. For Belloc, as for the West,
tradition begins in the family: the Yule log was burnt in
his home. From the family, tradition spread to the region:
he rendered Sussex immortal. From the region, man recovers
those wider circles of his story—the nation, the
state, the broad sweep of the Empire: some forty books
enshrine the Bellocian effort. All of this is finally stamped
one by the Faith that issued from the Incarnation.</p>

<p>Belloc’s historical work is divided broadly into two chief
fields of interest: England and France; and within these
respective areas of concentration a particular era predominates:
in England it is the Reformation, down to the final
exile of the Stuart Kings; in France, it is the Revolution
and the Napoleonic Empire. Transcending these broad interests,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
there are works which deal with the wider sweep
of Western History from before the Incarnation, down
through the Middle Ages, up to the Reformation and
even beyond World War I to the <i>Crisis of Our Civilization</i>.
Biography and general history incarnate the above work.
Besides all that, Belloc has produced an odd dozen specialized
monographs which deal with subjects close to his
heart: studies on the Roman Road, on Sussex, on cities and
their river tributaries, and finally on military history. The
first two attach to his general European history and illustrate
his “pro-Roman” and “pro-Catholic” positions. The
military monographs are grouped chiefly, although not
exclusively, around England. Not including his travel
books, which illustrate historical matter, one can count
forty-six books written by Belloc that are historical in the
full sense of the term.</p>

<p>The story of Belloc’s going up to Oxford as an undergraduate,
astounding the University with his brilliance
and pugnacity, is well known. The story of his exclusion
from Oxford as a tutor because of his bellicose Catholicism
may be revealed some day. In any case, this rebuff added
something personal to his bitterness against what he called
the “official history” of the great English Universities.
His work must be understood in relation to the two historical
trends that he reacted against with such violence:
the Whig tradition of Gibbon, Mommsen, Macaulay,
Green, and their copyists and sycophants; and the implicit
idealism and anti-traditionalism of German <i>Historismus</i>.
Because he was engaged in a conscious and articulate controversy
with these two historical schools for almost fifty
years, an understanding of what he is opposing is indispensable
for placing Belloc as an historian.</p>

<p>Present-day English history has maintained a steady, unbroken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
continuity with eighteenth-century political Whiggery
and eighteenth-century rationalism. History was an
admirable tool for the elucidation of doctrines peculiarly
dear to the whole Enlightenment (as Voltaire so clearly
grasped). The indefinite perfectibility of human reason
could be illustrated historically by showing the advance of
man out of medieval darkness into the light of the Age
of Reason. Here the specific dogmas of rationalist deism
<i>happened</i> to coincide with the prejudices of popular Protestantism:
that the Church was foisted on an unwilling
Empire at the caprice of Constantine the Great; that the
barbarian hordes from the east swept over the body of
Rome and breathed a new life into Europe that flowered
eventually in a host of Protestant institutions; that the Dark
Ages extended into the high Middle Ages and were expelled
only by the advent of the Renaissance of learning
(executed, if not initiated by scholars freed from the
tyranny of Rome); that the growth of Parliamentary
Government in Holland and England was the work of disinterested
patriots forging a future freed from feudal
darkness and oppression—all these opinions, dear to the
traditions of the Glorious Revolution, were simply corollaries
of the rationalist doctrine of the expanding perfection
of mankind. Darwinism was only a latter-day
confirmation of this ideology. From Protestant opinion and
rationalist philosophy was born the thing known as Whig
History. The eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Whig-rationalist
was dead certain that he had in his hands the
guide lines to historical understanding. It seems significant
that even old-line Tories who politically opposed the bulk
of the Whig-Liberal traditions fell into the general Whig
position. Bolingbroke himself was a victim of pre-Darwinian
evolutionism.</p>

<p>Since man was supposed to have <i>progressed</i> to that point
in time where the historian stood, history was judged from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
the vantage point of the present. Everything from before
Christ, down to the decline of the Roman Empire, the
Dark and Middle Ages, through the Renaissance and beyond
the Reformation was measured by standards peculiar
to the present. The past received its intelligibility in the
light of where man happened to find himself. All this followed
on a doctrine of inevitable progress. Since the present
was the high point of cultural and personal development,
the past was considered ministerially. Our fathers
were condescended to.</p>

<p>Now it is extremely significant that Hilaire Belloc, almost
alone of his Edwardian generation, reversed that historical
perspective. He called before the bar of Christendom the
capitalist, industrialist present, and found it wanting. Belloc
insisted on judging the present in the light of the past, and
the past itself was seen in terms of <i>its</i> own immediate and
remote antecedents. The reality of the European traditions
of individual freedom and proprietary justice, the very
being of cultural historical continuity, entered bodily into
his perspective. Whereas the Whig historian judged King
Charles I, to take an obvious example, in the light of the
twentieth-century development to liberal parliamentary
government, Belloc saw the man in terms of the ancient
traditions of popular monarchy within the law for which
the Stuart monarch died. Cromwell, for the Whig historian,
was he who made for parliamentary supremacy; for
Belloc, Cromwell was he who was made by an aristocracy
swollen with the wealth of the religious revolution.</p>

<p>Since Belloc’s conception of history is traditional and
organic, he constantly insisted on judging the past in the
light of the lines of efficient causality that were actually productive
of this or that historical event or crisis. These lines
are many and diverse, but at least one of them, Belloc insists,
renders European history a steady continuity. This
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
line of causality is the Catholic and Greco-Roman classical
tradition; an almost immemorial tradition existing in the
present in two dimensions: corporately—in Christendom as
a whole, molding it by shaping institutions, forming consciences,
transforming the land, incarnating the hopes of
generations of men in the visual and literary arts, and
handing on the religious heritage to the unborn; and
personally—as summing itself up in a man, annealing him,
and giving direction to his destiny.</p>

<p>In taking his historical stand on the Catholic tradition,
Belloc was fitting his historical judgment to a reality that
had been, and although radically attenuated still was, the
one bond of continuity that could enable the historian to
grasp a steady, continuous causality in his province. The
Whig doctrines were myths, but even assuming for a moment
that the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries
were superior to the Medieval and Continental traditions—that
the present was the threshold to a golden age, as the
Victorians and Edwardians still thought—nonetheless, that
supposition was completely valueless as a principle of historical
explanation.</p>

<p>The Whig historian and his Liberal counterpart attempt
to find some intelligibility or meaning in history. The rejection
of the Catholic ethos robs the Whig of the one steady,
continuous influence that has always operated in the West
through the ages. The Whig cannot, for example, see the
rise of liberty as something caused by the Faith, as an <i>effect</i>
of an institution already in existence. His dilemma consists
in seeing a genuine growth in liberty; his rejection of the
Catholic tradition forces him to one of two alternatives:
either liberty is purely fortuitous and has no over-all historical
cause, and history is thereby totally unintelligible;
or liberty is the effect of something not actually in existence,
but which is conceived as though it were. From the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
latter issues the Liberal-Whig mythology of “progress,”
“evolution,” “human perfectibility,” and so on. What these
historians seem incapable of understanding is that these
formulas stand for nothing but tissues of imagery, existing
in the minds of men who view historical situations after
the fact. In no sense did “progress” ever cause anything
historical, for the simple reason that “progress” <i>has no
being</i> of its own. Yet the Liberals treat these constructs
as though they were physical laws operative in the extramental
order. Belloc had more than a lively grip on this
fallacy, and he fingered it for the imaginative trick it is,
in his controversy with H. G. Wells.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When Mr. Wells concludes this passage by saying “I strut to
no such personal beatitude,” and then goes on to say, “the life
to which I belong uses me and will go on beyond me, and I am
content,” he does two unintelligent things. First of all, he mixes
up the real with the imaginary ... and next he falls into the
very common error of confused intellects—the personification
of abstract ideas. “The life to which we belong uses us” is a
meaningless phrase. God may use us or we may use ourselves,
or some other third Will, not God’s or our own, may use us:
but “the life to which we belong” does not use us. Talking like
that is harmless when it is mere metaphor, it is asinine when it
sets up to be definition.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39">[39]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Wells was not alone in this personification of the abstract.
He was only a popularizer of a tendency that is ever
at work in all historical theory that commences by minimizing
the religious causality operative in the West. The
Whig substituted for the Catholic tradition an over-all
finality which he called “progress.” The idealist historian
and the <i>Weltanschauung</i> historian add to the Whig denial
the negation of the personal will. All the historian is left
to work with are impersonal forces, either physical or
logical. He falls into the old error of laying his eggs in a
basket that does not exist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>The Liberal is bound by his own theory. His sociological
ideals must be projected ahead of his historical understanding;
they can never emerge from an insight into that which
actually has existed. The classical European Liberal (and
his contemporary counterpart) is always marked by his
rejection of any way of life rooted in the older past of
Christendom.</p>

<p>When Hilaire Belloc launched his concept of the proprietary
state, he effected a political and sociological revolution
that had its roots in his historical vision. Mr. Douglas
Jerrold has analyzed brilliantly the profound effect made
by Belloc’s polemic against the English parliamentary party
system which was wedded to Whig ideals and their Edwardian
Liberal refinements.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40">[40]</a> It was a time when Britain
had reached next to the limit of its material expansion.
English industry and productivity were unequalled in
excellence and quantity. The nation was united in the firm
conviction that Britannia ruled by the grace of God. Providence
had specially blessed the Island Empire. The innate
superiority, not only of Englishmen, but of English ways
and English religion, was less a conscious doctrine than
a broad myth on which a whole people reposed. Liberal
capitalism appeared to the “progressivists” as the final
flowering of a history that had its roots in the Reformation
and the Glorious Revolution of 1688.</p>

<p>Belloc’s economics and sociology, the fruit of his historical
insight, effected a revolution. Since it was a revolution
of thought, its effects were not immediately apparent,
but acting as corrosives they gradually ate away the
rust of centuries of complacency and smugness. Belloc
told the Englishmen of his day that their cherished system
of parliamentary government represented not the nation,
but two parties that stood for the same thing: capitalist,
industrial wealth. He went on to tell them that the supposed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
incorruptibility of this ancient governmental institution
was a lie: men were bought and sold, and titles were
bartered for privilege.</p>

<p>Expanding his polemic, Belloc informed the nation that
liberal capitalism would not issue into the golden age, but
would work inexorably toward the Servile State: a state in
which the vast majority of the populace laboured perforce
for a small minority of wealthy owners, or for an entrenched
government dominated by technical experts. He
grounded his predictions on the drying up of the traditional
economic basis of Western Christian societies: the
institution of small property, widely distributed, giving the
tone to society, and reposing on the family community. As
far back as 1908, in <i>The Servile State</i>, Belloc deduced that
unless the institution of property were reestablished, the
nation would give itself over to slavery. The England of
the late forties and early fifties has borne him out with
tragic finality. Belloc contended that party control was
an irrelevant point; if the society were propertyless, contractual
slavery would inexorably result. The age of the
ration card, the social leveling of the whole people, the
increasing drabness of life, the elimination of the middle
classes, the legislation of enforced labour—this age is upon
England, and it will remain until and unless property is
restored.</p>

<p>Belloc’s prophecies were successes in the only way any
prophecy can succeed. What he said would come to pass
did come to pass; and it came to pass the way he said it
would. There is more than irony in looking back thirty
years to that superman of the Wells school of thought:
that uninhibited, traditionless blank who was to be the
term of the march of liberal progress; that dull abstraction,
“the man of the future,” who was to inherit the earth.
Who is he today, and where is he? He is the industrial
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
slave of an impoverished and spiritually bankrupt Europe—Heidegger’s
faceless “one” who neither owns nor can be
said even to be.</p>

<p>The striking truth in the utter failure of the hopes of
post-Victorian Liberalism lies in the fact that Liberalism,
the child of Whiggery, grounded its predictions in an historical
theory that was a well-intentioned myth. The future
simply is not a magnet. It has no existence. It is a refuge
for cowards, Chesterton said somewhere; a retreat for men
who cannot bear to face the grandeur of their own past.
Belloc was able to lay down the broad lines which were
leading to the Servile State because his historical vision was
orientated realistically: it looked to causes actually operative
in the past, whose collective efficacy hardened and
sharpened with the passing of time. The English Reformation
had created a wealthy landed aristocracy. This aristocracy
had ruined a crown that for all its failures had
stood, immemorially, for the rights of the common man,
already a landed owner in large part by the close of the
fourteenth century. Having gained political power, the
aristocracy usurped economic power; the long series of
legislative acts and judicial decisions, from the Poor Laws
to the final enclosure acts, ended in the creation of a rural
proletariat. The rise of industrialism was controlled by a
capitalism already in existence, and the rural proletariat was
transformed into its urban counterpart.</p>

<p>Belloc’s prophetic ability, strikingly demonstrated time
and again, worked because it was based on his grasp of
causality actually operative in history. The future can
never be predicted with certitude because causes operating
at the present moment in time are contingent. They can be
replaced, diminished, checked, or rechannelled. Nonetheless,
to have an insight into these causes is to possess an
instrument for predicting a possible or even probable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
future. No historical theory grounded in a mere <i>Weltanschauung</i>,
nor any history deduced from a philosophical
system such as the Hegelian and Marxist, is of any practical
utility in understanding what might happen.</p>

<p>Another example of Belloc’s prophetic insight can be
found in his book about the United States, <i>The Contrast</i>.
Writing in 1924, before the New Deal was even a dream,
Belloc calmly announced that a great increase of Presidential
power would be effected in the near future. His historical
thesis, still paradoxical to most of his readers, was
that great wealth always operated through representative
institutions, and always aimed, neither at monarchy nor
democracy, but at aristocracy. In a country in which the
sense of individual liberty was still strong, the people would
tend to incarnate themselves more and more in the head
of the state, who, by his very position, stood above special
interests, which worked naturally through parliamentary
structures. One does not have to agree with Belloc that
this monarchical tendency was a good thing; but it must
be granted that he nailed the tendency to the wall.</p>

<p>Belloc’s historical insight passes the pragmatic test time
and again. Another example of history rendered intelligible
when seen in the light of the traditions of Christendom
was Belloc’s very early penetration of the essential foreignness
of Prussia to the family of nations that constitute
Europe. Prussia, the legitimate child of the Reformation,
arose and developed apart from the older European Unity.
Of her very nature she opposed that unity, and refused to
be bound by the morality common to Christian nations and
men. Frederick the Great’s rape of Silesia, the work of
Bismarck, the over-all meaning of the First Reich and of
World War I make sense only within the context of Belloc’s
discussion of the problem. When all England and the
United States as well were singing the praises of the Nordic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
man and the superiority of the blond beast of the north,
Belloc knew what Prussia really meant: a gun pointed at the
heart of the West. The resurrection of Prussianism under
Hitler confirmed bitterly the prophetic insight of Belloc,
who had been warning England for over forty years about
the intentions of North Germany. Belloc knew where
Prussia stood in the light of the unity of Christendom. She
was beyond the pale.</p>

<p>It is largely due to the Bellocian polemic that the old-fashioned
Whig history, although still taught as a matter
of course almost everywhere, is no longer the accepted
dogma of serious historical scholarship. Historians today
can labour at their profession without the fear that their
work will be branded as partisan, as is the work of the man
who cleared the field for them.</p>

<p>Belloc’s historical technique suffered from one self-imposed
liability. He worked within a tradition, and thereby
defined himself. But his strength lay in his very limitation.
The Bellocian philosophy of history can operate only
within some one well-defined civilization. The effectiveness
of his method depends on the historian’s entering profoundly
into the spirit of a culture, and on assuming to
himself the religious and social beliefs and values of the
society in question. Without his Catholicism, or without
at least a deep sympathy for the religion that made Christendom,
Belloc’s historical method cannot be made to function
realistically. It is of no use, for example, to a man who
would work toward an historical understanding of global
history. World history must be seen, to the Bellocian, as
something outside of the European Unity, as something
foreign, threatening that unity, or as penetrated by it. To
enter into a diversity of religious and cultural traditions in
order to grasp the complete picture of world history <i>from
within</i> is a psychological impossibility. A man would break
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
down under the strain, because he cannot take to himself
traditions that are mutually contradictory. He cannot be
that which he rejects.</p>

<p>Philosophies of world history always wear that curious
air of unreality typified by academic journals or international
youth congresses. So long as these historians simply
record facts they are safe, but as soon as they attempt
explanations they break down because of their necessary
lack of inside understanding. World historians frequently
fail to grasp even the story of their own nations. They
are within nothing at all, but are self-estranged cultural
strangers looking at the world from an academic outside;
hence they fail to grasp the spirit of anything that has ever
moved men to common action. These historians tend to succumb
to the facile temptation of writing history synthetically;
they perpetually find meetings between an East and
West, where there is only conflict; they fall into the trap
of treating history cyclically; they build vast structures in
the air that reveal nothing to a man searching for his own
antecedents. A Christian comes away from Belloc knowing
his own soul.</p>

<p>The <i>Weltanschauung</i> historian must fail in the end because
no “world view” has ever acted to cause anything
historically. History is caused within cultures, and the clash
of civilizations occurs when two cultures in act meet on
the field of battle, be it economic, military, or spiritual.</p>

<p>The final objection that the “world historian” has against
Belloc is that he takes sides, and the final answer to that
objection is simply this: to refuse to take sides is to refuse
to enter history. A historian who does not see that rather
brutal fact will never see more than the surface of things.
He cannot see the inside of the spiritual drama of, let us
say, the Reformation or the Arian heresy, without being
touched by an absolute: absolutes either wound or enlist
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
the assent of the spirit. There can be no impartiality when
a man has been actually grazed by the realities that have
stirred all Christianity to its roots. Intellectual aloofness
to the issues of life and death simply demonstrates that
these frontiers of the soul have not been reached by the
historian, and unless they are reached and elected for or
rejected, nothing historical can be known in its very substance.
<i>Credo ut intelligam.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Now then, so it is with us who are of the Faith and the great
story of Europe. A Catholic as he reads that story does not
grope at it from without, he understands it from within ... he
is also that which he has to understand. The Faith is Europe and
Europe is the Faith.</p>

<p>The Catholic brings to history (when I say “history” in
these pages I mean the history of Christendom) self-knowledge.
As a man in the confessional accuses himself of what he knows
to be true, and what other people cannot judge, so a Catholic,
talking of the united European civilization, when he blames it,
blames it for motives and for acts which are his own. He himself
could have done those things in person. He is not relatively
right in this blame, he is absolutely right. As a man can testify
to his own motive, so can the Catholic testify to unjust, irrelevant,
or ignorant conceptions of the European story; for he
knows why and how it proceeded. Others, not Catholic, look
upon the story of Europe externally as strangers. <i>They</i> have to
deal with something which presents itself to them partially and
disconnectedly, by its phenomena alone: <i>he</i> sees it all from its
centre in its essence, and together.</p>

<p>I say again, renewing the terms, The Church is Europe: and
Europe is the Church.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41">[41]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The Bellocian concept of history, as set forth in the
above passage, might well be called Anselmian: historical
understanding follows Faith. If history is an extension of
a complex line of traditions unified through a common
religion, then it follows necessarily that history can be
grasped only from within. The historian who views the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
European story as a series of “phenomena” external to himself
must either fall into the Aristotelian conception of
history as mere chronology, or he must superimpose on
this series some conceptual framework to render it intelligible.
He simply cannot enter into its spirit and see with
the eyes of the men he would know, or feel with them as
they erupt into common action. He is alienated from them.</p>

<p>Belloc has been attacked by historians, both Catholic and
non-Catholic, for partisanship, bias, and narrow dogmatism.
There is more than a little truth to their charges. Belloc
frequently bludgeons his readers. In the later books he
forces them into line with a prose that is almost martial in
its proud magnificence: its certainty. But all this is part of
the price Belloc had to pay to become the kind of historian
he did. He is within what he is writing. Do not ask for impartiality
when reading of the First Crusade. Belloc is there:
he is one of the Crusaders. When you know Belloc, you
know the Crusades, you know the revolutionary spirit that
swept all France in the eighteenth century; when you have
read <i>Esto Perpetua</i> the grandeur of the first three centuries
of the Christian era comes home to the soul amidst the contrast
of the barren desert of Islam. You understand what
Islam meant to Europe. Belloc gives a reader a one-sided
history, but the irony is that, to a Bellocian, history must
always be one-sided. The man “on no side” is outside
history.</p>

<p>Paradoxically enough, Belloc’s contention runs exactly
contrary to the first principle of modern Western historical
theory. Contemporary historians, regardless of political
predilection or religious and philosophical adherence, are
united in the common belief that historical truth is dependent
on historical “objectivity.” This objectivity is
achieved in proportion to the historian’s ability to withdraw
from his own cultural antecedents. In so doing, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
scholar shakes himself loose from the prejudices and parochialisms
of his own civilization, he frees himself, in
order that he may view the whole. The story of his people
and of his own faith recede until they take their just place
within the broader scope of the cosmic movement of historical
man through time.</p>

<p>It is questionable whether such an objectivity can be
more than an ideal projected before the historian—a goal
to be forever missed, but always aimed at. But assuming
for a moment that it is possible for a single historian to
hold before himself the global passage of man through
recorded history, assuming that he could find a set of
natural principles that would unify this vast procession of
phenomena into an intelligible structure—even assuming
this ideal of the Toynbee school of thought—it still remains
an open question whether this would constitute the possession
of historical <i>truth</i>.</p>

<p>If, on the contrary (assuming Belloc’s hypothesis), historical
truth principally means historical <i>understanding</i> of
the men who have made history, then this understanding
can only follow on a grasp of the spiritual tides that have
launched any given culture, that have given it a common
destiny, that have been channelled analogically through
the members of the community. Historical truth depends
then on a subjective, almost intuitive, grasp of this communal
spirit; a penetration into historical man, rather than
an analytic dissection of a spirit that defies mere logical
analysis. Historical understanding escapes the kind of objectivity
achieved in the sciences, because it demands a
deeper insight: an entering into the subjective engagement
of the human person. To understand what has caused me
to be the kind of man I am, I must understand what caused
the men who made me to be what they were. I possess my
past, in Belloc’s eyes, when I am that past to such a degree
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
that I could have acted as did my ancestors. Then, and only
then, do I actually know my own fathers from within the
depths of my own personality.</p>

<p>Outside objectivity versus inside understanding; conscious
withdrawal and deliberate cultural alienation for the
sake of objectivity, as opposed to conscious cultural immersion
and integration for the sake of subjective sympathy:
two theories of history that can be resolved finally only by
a personal act of choice.</p>

<p>Belloc’s historical theory is anti-academic in that it cannot
be achieved within the confines of the world of the
university. As both an historical position and an historical
practice it must always be suspect to professional historical
scholars, whose almost exclusive preoccupation with <i>documents</i>
makes them, quite naturally, more sympathetic to the
scientific objectivity of contemporary history. Belloc must
always appear, by turns, wildly romantic and narrowly
partisan to the academicians. To the Bellocian, academicism
in history must always lack both colour and vigour. It
must wear an air of irritating professionalism.</p>

<p>Belloc’s position absolutely necessitated his emphasis on
travel, his minute detection of physical details, his sympathy
with verbal tradition, his suspicion for the “outlander.”
These were all humanistic instruments, rendering him one
with the past, capable of seeing things as did his forefathers,
understanding reality as they did, and eventually grasping
the inner spirit of their personal and communal action that
constitutes the heart of their history.</p>

<p>Such history is both conservative in ultimate judgment
and it is radical: conservative in that it proceeds by way
of a personal guarding of an ancient heritage; radical in that
it makes a man totally opposed to a new world at odds with
that heritage. The final and the fatal limitation to Bellocian
history is that it depends for success on a constant living
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
continuity, on a vital tradition acting like a road the historian
can travel down and back again at will. The radical
discontinuity of the modern world with its past in the older
Christendom makes it almost impossible for anyone to perpetuate
Belloc’s historical practice. It is becoming increasingly
more difficult, if not impossible, <i>to be</i> spiritually and
affectively one with our heritage. The past of Christendom
is becoming more and more a written patrimony, and the
Bellocian brand of historical integration cannot thrive on
such jejune food.</p>

<p>History by way of inside understanding is practicable
today only on a regional and familial basis; and even the
family, within the industrialized world, has lost any living
touch with its own dead. The father has become a stranger
to his son.</p>

<p>For Belloc, therefore, an apprehension of the European
past demands an understanding and a sympathy for the
Catholic Faith, tending to allegiance, if not to formal profession.
As Belloc sees it, only such an history can comprehend
the over-all pressure of the Christian dispensation
as it exercised a steady influence on the person and on
society; acting always as a balm, sometimes as a force, both
conservative and full of ringing affirmations that are not
of this world. Nonetheless, Belloc affirms, this apprehension
is of itself sufficient to insure only an over-all sane judgment
about things historical. The Christian vision, to perfect
itself historically, must take on a judgment that is temporal,
human, and almost cynical in its realism. The great
Action advances or retreats as it is involved in the individual
actions of ages, generations, decades, and even days and
hours. These, in their turn, are caused by a host of agents,
tangling one with another, clashing in opposition and uniting
in the coincidence of common interest: causes which
are both impersonal and personal, but chiefly the latter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>The historian, says Belloc, must possess himself of a
mass of detailed impersonal information, which must be
sifted and fitted into proper perspective. “But if he is not
seized of the mind which lay behind all that was human in
the business, then no synthesis of his detailed knowledge
is possible.”<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42">[42]</a> In short, as Mr. Robert Hamilton pointed out
in his study on Belloc, the historian must be a humanist. He
must understand men and the motives that move them. History,
to be faithful to what was actually productive of the
past, must go beyond the physical, phenomenal evidence
at hand. A judgment of motive will normally transcend the
synthesis of observable fact. A man of action (unless he be
a Communist) does not give himself away on paper. His
motives must be inferred from the way he acts. A detailed
observation of a man’s conduct over a period of time and
through a succession of historical crises will yield sufficient
evidence for an over-all judgment as to his intentions, and
hence to his place in the historical drama in which he was
engaged. No one piece of information is sufficient for such
an evaluation. The sum of facts, considered separately,
would yield only probability concerning the directed
human will. The information as synthesized, however,
permits of an inductive judgment yielding a species of certitude
about the moral role men play in history. In <i>The
Cruise of the Nona</i>, that mosaic of Bellociana, the theory
is put forth by the author that a sum of probabilities can
furnish certitude, if that sum is taken as a patterned whole.
It looks as though Belloc is here reflecting the influence of
his early teacher, John Henry Newman, who developed
an epistemology around this conception of certitude as
emerging from a set of probabilities. When all the evidence
together points to one conclusion, converges on one exclusive
explanation, then the mind should assent to that one
conclusion without fear of the truth of the opposite. It is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
clear that this is a risky and dangerous instrument for the
acquisition of historical truth. A fool, or a mind purely
speculative or deductive in bent, would bungle in attempting
such judgments. A mind overly pious and overly sanguine
about human nature, or excessively cynical about the
good in men, would not be suited for the task. It is an instrument
for a humanist: a man who knows men as they
are. Belloc was peculiarly capable of exercising his own
theory, and if he erred sometimes, it was on the side of
cynicism, not piety.</p>

<p>Belloc’s theory of history is not developed philosophically
in any one piece of writing. He tosses out his ideas
within the limits of short personal essays, and occasionally
he illuminates what he is doing in some concrete situation
by standing back, as it were, and reflecting briefly on the
presuppositions guiding his reasoning. He wrote history
<i>analogically</i>, and if he had thoroughly developed his doctrine
theoretically, he would have revealed something
unique in the philosophy of historical practice. Historical
research, if it would conform itself with historical truth,
must be analogical as is historical truth itself. A diversity
of causal lines, one at least almost immemorial, others
lengthening into centuries, and still others contracted
within the space of a man’s life or within a lesser temporal
span, all act together to produce history, but each causal
line acts in its own way. The historian must constantly shift
his perspective as he makes his way through this tangle of
actualities, which encompass everything from a living
Faith, through the whole gamut of human vice and honour,
to the half-forgotten contours of the field of battle. No one
factor <i>determines</i> history (although one factor—the Christian
Greco-Roman tradition—renders history <i>intelligible</i>).
Herein Belloc is consciously separated from Marxist history,
which would explain the past as determined exclusively
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
through economic pressures. Even more so is the
Bellocian theory opposed to the Hegelian or dialectical
concept of history in which the past is judged to be caused
by a logical clash of ideas which work themselves out in
time, independently of, or dominating, the counter-pressure
of human action.</p>

<p>To study, think, and write history as Belloc did demands
a rare brand of personal integration. A personal Faith,
through which the Christian tradition is comprehended,
is united with humanism, through which the human and
non-human causes operative in history are accorded their
just causality in the judgment of the past. These lines of
causality must be kept distinct, but they cannot be separated.
If they are separated, the historian will fall into some
kind of Barthianism, in which the Gospel is conceived as
a message that acts through the ages independently of men
and society, and in which secular man goes his own way
totally uneffected by the Christian dispensation. If, on the
contrary, the lines of causality are identified, then history
is turned into the pious hagiography of fashionable French
ladies of the last century. To ignore or to minimize either
the Church or the secular is to fail to understand Western
Europe.</p>

<p>As an example of Belloc’s balancing of historical causality
one should watch him in act as he analyzes the French
Revolution. A host of causes made the Revolution: the
Christian doctrine of human equality; the ruining of the
prestige of the monarchy by Louis XV’s public indulgence
of the flesh prolonged into middle and old age; the antiquated
system of taxation, based on a defunct manorial
society, which bankrupted the realm; the extravagance
and scandal given by a woman too long denied the rights of
marriage; Drouet’s ride (“Good Lord, what a ride!” says
Belloc); the heroism of the French at Wattignies; the democratic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
spirit of the Gauls united so paradoxically with the
temper of the soldier—these were all actual causes of the
Revolution. The failure of almost any one of them would
have ruined or at least modified the Revolution.</p>

<p>When faced with these facts, few historians would deny
the rightness of Belloc’s contention. But it remains true that
these causes, all of which moved to one effect, are not
actually operative within the minds of most academic historians
when they set down the story. What use would
an Hegelian have for that splendid ride that headed off the
flight of the King? His theory cannot admit that wild contingency,
full of the drama of human existence, to have
altered the course of history. He is bound by his own dialectic.
Neither the free will of Drouet, nor the strength of
the man’s horse, nor the quality of his skill, can genuinely
enter Hegelian history; nor can they enter the systems of
Spengler and those contemporary historians influenced by
him, because <i>systems</i> of constructs cannot admit of the
drama of historical contingency. What modern vulgarian,
conditioned by our mechanical theories about sex, can
<i>really</i> understand Marie Antoinette—so Catholic at the
end, and always so much the woman! Theories of history
can take these contingencies and admit them as <i>facts</i>,
but they can not use them in their over-all explanations.
These historians are not humanists, but are men who would
like to be scientists in a realm that escapes the purely
scientific.</p>

<p>For an insight into Belloc’s humanist penetration, one
could do little better than to read him on King Charles I
of England. For centuries Charles has been a puzzle to
students of history: carrying with him all the glamour of
the Stuarts, he was certainly the noblest of that ill-omened
house (if one except James Francis Edward), and yet why
did he let Strafford go to his death? This moral failure of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
the King is contradicted by his heroism through the whole
civil war, from the raising of the royal standard at Nottingham
to his execution. Charles simply does not look like
a well-intentioned weakling: we cannot think of him as
a coward at one instant and a hero at the next; there is a
constancy about his whole life, and how can this constancy
be understood in the light of the death of Strafford? Explained
it must be, if the English Civil War is to make
sense. Belloc, uniting the Newmanian technique of converging
probabilities with the insight of a humanist, draws
this sketch of the man’s character:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I may compare the effects of his inward strength to the effects
produced by one kind of resistance against an impact.</p>

<p>When men plan to make impact against resistance in the will
of another they expect, and commonly find, at first a resistance.
They proceed to wear it down. If it gets less, they are introduced
to a last struggle in which, when they have taken all
the outworks, they may naturally expect to succeed. So it was
with the pressure brought against the boy’s father, James I, in
the first beginnings of the revolt of the gentry against him.
James’ Parliaments—that is, the country gentlemen—pushed him
further and further. Such an action is like a siege, it can have
but one end, and as we know, James, fighting from trench to
trench, always, in the end, gave way.</p>

<p>Then again, there is the kind of resistance offered by men
who are adamant in the beginning. They bluntly refuse, and if
you lose your first battle against them you can go no further.</p>

<p>But Charles was to be neither of these. His nature, trained in
isolation, was fluid against the first onset of attack; then there
came a moment when the attack reached something quite different
from the first fluid resistance—a stone wall. It was thus that
he came to his death. Men were led on to think him pliable;
when they came unexpectedly on rigidity, they were infuriated.</p>

<p>Now this distinction, I take it, between his fixity upon certain
things, well defined in his own mind, and his indecision or
rather lack of convinced <i>cause</i> for resistance on the rest—this
quality in him which kept in reserve and hidden an ultimate
power of complete refusal (even to martyrdom) took root, I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
say, in these very early years when he was compelled, almost
against himself, to consider in private what remedy he could
find for his defects.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43">[43]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Belloc did not find the above in any written document,
admitting of a learned footnote. He concluded to it, following
on a study of all the available data. His moral judgment
concerning Charles would be called “romancing” by
historians of one brand of the <i>Historismus</i> school. If history
is but surface phenomena or ideology, then these men are
right. But if history has been <i>caused</i> efficiently, in part, by
men acting in all their strength and failing in their weaknesses,
then the Bellocian method is dangerously right:
right, because without such a method history remains incomplete
and even superficial; dangerous, because the
humanist instrument is a delicate rapier and not one to be
used without caution, skill, and human understanding. One
cannot affirm that Belloc always kept the necessary balance,
but he kept it steadily enough through a lifetime of
historical labour to have bequeathed us a kind of history
rarely written in these days, or in any day for that matter:
history which respects tradition, both political and religious,
and history which respects the human person in all
the tissue of good and evil from whence proceeds human
action.</p>

<p>Although the use of the technique of “converging probabilities”
frequently issues into judgments that are humanist,
i.e. judgments about men, Belloc used his method in
the earlier years to establish historical truths that are only
incidentally concerned with human personality. In these
impersonal studies about battles, roads, rivers, etc., Belloc
pointed up his polemic against the German Idealist school
that refused to deal with <i>things</i>. <i>The Stane Street</i>, written
in 1913, is possibly the most brilliant success he achieved
in this kind of historical investigation. Although the book
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
was severely written, with little of the high rhetoric associated
with much of Belloc’s history, there are two passages
that reveal Belloc’s attack against historical idealism.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Let me not be misunderstood; the repeated view that Britain
was a sparsely inhabited and only partially Romanised province,
is one which no one today with a care for historical truth will
maintain. It arose in that hypothetical and North German
school of history which prefers to accumulate facts rather than
co-ordinate evidence; which delights to give guesswork an equal
rank with record, and invariably to oppose that guesswork
against the tradition of civilization ... there has grown up a
deplorable academic habit which will build most readily upon
the very absence of proof, and one must refute such falsehood
before one can proceed to truth ... <i>the mere lack of evidence
is used for the purposes of confident negation</i> ... it is the
peculiar disease of our time in this province of inquiry.</p>

<p>For instance, we know nothing of London between the time
when Imperial Rome still taxed and administered Britain and
the seventh century, when, with the return of the Catholic
Church, writing and record returned. Wherefore a whole
school has risen which will solemnly maintain the fantastical
theory that London in the interval did—what? why, ceased to
exist!</p>

<p>No one who has had the good fortune to escape from the
influence of the Universities will be ready to believe that they
make themselves responsible for so amazing a statement. It is
none the less true. Because we do not know what happened to
London between one fixed date ... and another ... therefore
it has been solemnly put forward under academic authority that
London in the interval disappeared!</p>

<p>It is folly, of course. It is as clear an abandonment of common
sense as it would be to deny the existence of our homes during
the hours when we happen to be absent from them.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44">[44]</a></p>
</div>

<p>It is amusing to note that one phrase in the above passage
was repeated almost verbatim twenty years later, when
Belloc wrote of his dead companion Chesterton, that “he
had the singular good fortune to have escaped the University.”
He wrote this phrase in a context dealing with Chesterton’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
<i>realism</i>. This was the same Chesterton who had
said that the only sin was “to call green grass grey.” It was
the same Chesterton who saw with his friend that there is
one, implicit, rarely articulated first principle behind the
modern mind: <i>things are not what they seem to be</i>; the
postulate of an impoverished universe, as it has been called.
Whig history was one enemy; but the great enemy against
which Belloc directed his historical guns was German
<i>Historismus</i>, the child of Hegelian idealism, and the enemy
of reality.</p>

<p>The development of historiography and the application
of scientific techniques to historical evidence arose in Germany
and was saddled from the outset by a philosophy that
was utterly contemptuous of realism and of the common
sense of mankind that accepts implicitly the proposition
that “things are.” If historical method had grown up unencumbered
by ideological weeds, the Western World would
never have seen the great destructive attack made on Scripture
in the last half of the nineteenth century by German
scholarship. It seems reasonable to assume that the new
scholarly techniques would have aided men like Belloc in
exploding the older Whig myths. Things did not happen
that way, because the academic mind behind the new
method was corrupted with the pride of idealism. It was a
mind diseased to the core that laid its hands on everything
hitherto held sacred and true by the united conscience of
Christendom. German historical research, around the last
quarter of the nineteenth century, touched nothing that it
did not negate: filial traditions, the lore of the old rooted
peasantries of Europe, religious symbolism whose meaning
had been settled for centuries, finally Scripture
itself.</p>

<p>This was one of the Barbarians who can never build, but
who can only destroy that from which he feeds. Chesterton
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
fought the same battle against these iconoclasts on the
level of comparative religion that Belloc fought on the
level of secular history. They united in an assault against
the idol-breakers, against that mentality that refuses to look
and see what is there to be seen. Their enemy was a mind
primed by two hundred years of an idealism that had permeated
every artery of thought and action with a suspicion
of being, a truculence before the things which are. If the
things which engage the senses and call forth the assent of
the intellect interfere with academic theory, then the things
are thrown away, and the theory wins the day. If physical
evidence attests to a late and active Roman influence in
ancient Britain, and in so doing contradicts official dogma,
then the evidence is to be ignored or explained away. If the
physical evidence of a document attests to its authenticity,
when a theory insists that it be a fraud, why then the document
is a fraud. If reason and the senses attest to an existing
world, and philosophy proclaims the contrary, then
so much the worse for the world.</p>

<p>Belloc keenly grasped the destructive tendencies at work
within the Western intelligentsia, which insisted on fencing
itself off from the world by weaving around itself
fabric upon fabric of theory. He had nothing but contempt
for the scholar who lives in a world of images, unrelated
to existing things. The typical Intellectual<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45">[45]</a> inevitably commences
to think in terms of, let us say, maps coloured this
way and that; he judges peoples and ideas according to the
standards of textbooks and fashionable opinions; he sees
the human person in the light of statistical tables (what
Belloc could have done with the American School of Education
mentality!); he measures reality by rulers laid on
sheets of cut cardboard, and by sums reckoned on pads of
paper. This sort of thing, typified and caused by idealism,
breeds jingoism, pacifism, internationalism, and other brands
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
of ideologies unrelated to reality, and conformed to nothing
but systems of phantasy and imagery.</p>

<p>Belloc’s historical attack against German <i>Historismus</i>
must be coupled with his social satire. Both functioned as
part of the same polemic against “the Barbarian.” As a
social satirist he sprayed his irony like acid on this mythological
world that has come upon the West. Dozens of his
essays and all of his nonsense novels are aimed at exposing
and ridiculing the contemporary loss of the sense for reality.
Belloc penetrated, sometimes almost inarticulately, into the
core of the business: if man is removed from being he
cannot be himself, and if he cannot be himself, he cannot
enter into the City of God, without which there is neither
happiness here nor beatitude beyond. This realization of
his rendered him the great iconoclast of the iconoclasts:
he broke the idols of the idol breakers. Science he openly
branded “the enemy of the truth.” Industrial Capitalism was
the “Servile State,” and the Successful Business Man was a
“share shuffler,” a “liar and thief”; art was a “stinking
trade,” because he knew well enough that this would blood
the solemnity of the <i>avant-garde</i>; advertising he labels a
“disgusting lie.” The servants of the rich are consigned to
the bottom of hell, and polite society is damned with the
incomparable:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left noindent">
  Good morning, Algernon: Good morning, Percy.<br />
  Good morning, Mrs. Roebeck. Christ have mercy!<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46">[46]</a>
</p>
</div>


<p>The attack against academic idealism was but the center
of Belloc’s broader assault, carried out through a dozen
different artistic media, against the <i>Zeitgeist</i>. To grasp the
essence of Belloc’s integrated Christian humanism is to
possess the key to understanding his position as a satirist
and controversialist. This age, Belloc repeats over and over
again, is not at one with the destiny worthy of a man.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
Belloc is ever hammering home one message: shake off this
bad dream, and look once again at reality, at being, at
Creation. “Dear reader, read less and sail more.”</p>

<p>In one of his farewell essays to Chesterton, Belloc declared
that the prime glory of his friend was to have seen
things as they are. In his own turn, and in his own way,
that was Belloc’s chief excellence, as it is the chief excellence
of any man who can claim right to public respect or
cultural frame.</p>

<p>Belloc, principally through his historical work, fought a
battle that was spiritual in origin. On the whole Belloc’s
attack seems to have been less effective than Chesterton’s,
because Chesterton brought to the battle an amazing good
humour and charity for the enemy. He slaps his foe on
the back, jokes with him, and enjoys himself hugely. Belloc
<i>publicly</i> glowers over against the foe. He was always
the Roman soldier holding the citadel against the savage
from without. Belloc brought to his task an extremely lucid
reason, French not only in its incisive keenness, but in its
cynicism as well. He could rarely accept the good will of
men who opposed his judgments. They were either fools
or liars.</p>

<p>There is some irony in Belloc’s judgment that Chesterton’s
effectiveness was blunted because of his charity. For
once, Belloc’s realism broke down, as does the realism of
the French break down, from time to time, when faced
with some great simplicity. It was Chesterton’s very “weakness”
(in Belloc’s eyes) that rendered him the more effective
of the two in this one aspect of their work: the polemic
against un-realism. Chesterton won by his very simplicity,
and by the greatness of his childlike vision—so sane and so
just, and so full of good will. Belloc made the enemy mad.
He stung them, and they reacted in the most deadly way
possible. They ignored him after a time, so that today
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
Belloc remains a writer who has not been tried and found
wanting, but who has simply not been tried at all.</p>

<p>Possibly Belloc was <i>too</i> effective in his war against the
Dons. He made fools of them, and then he insisted on
rubbing it in. There is an essay in <i>Hills and the Sea</i> called
“The Roman Road.” It is like many of Belloc’s essays: first
there is a bathing from the springs of something <i>in being</i>,
which is soaked into the author’s substance through his
senses. Then he brings his intellect to bear on whatever
it is that has engaged his whole personality, and some judgment
is passed. Frequently, the judgment is moral in character.
In this particular essay, Belloc relates the story of a
ride he took on his horse “Monster” over the old road
which presents “an eternal example” of what Rome
could do.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... That sign of Roman occupation, the modern word “Cold
Harbour,” is scattered up and down it. There are Roman pavements
on it. It goes plumb straight for miles, and at times,
wherever it crosses undisturbed land, it is three or four feet
above the level of the down. Here then, was a feast for the
learned: since certainly the more obvious a thing is, the more
glory there must be in denying it ... just as they will deny
that Austerlitz was fought in spite of Trafalgar, or that the
Gospel of Saint John is the Gospel of Saint John.</p>

<p>Here, then, sitting upon this Roman road I considered the
nature of such men and when I had thought out carefully where
the nearest Don might be at the moment, I decided that he
was at least twenty-three miles away, and I was very glad: for
it permitted me to contemplate the road with common sense,
and with Faith, which is Common Sense transfigured; and I
could see the Legionaries climbing the hill.... But chiefly
there returned as I gazed the delicious thought that learned
men, laborious and heavily endowed, had denied the <i>existence</i>
of this Roman road.... Here was a piece of pedantry and
skepticism which might make some men weep and some men
stamp with irritation ... but which fed in my own spirit a
fountain of pure joy. As I considered carefully what kind of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
man it is who denies these things; the kind of way he talks;
the kind of face he has; the kind of book he writes; the kind
of publisher who chisels him; and the kind of way in which
his works are bound.... With every moment my elation grew
greater and more impetuous.... But as they brought me beer
and bacon that evening, and I toasted the morning, the memory
of things past, I said to myself: “Oxford, Cambridge, Dublin,
Durham—you four great Universities—you terrors of Europe—that
road is older than you: and meanwhile I drink to your
continued healths, and let us have a little room ... air, give
us air, good people. I stifle when I think of you.”<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47">[47]</a></p>
</div>

<p>No wonder he was ignored! What else could they do
with a man like that? Once he subjected his own masterpiece,
<i>The Path to Rome</i>, to the techniques and presuppositions
of the “Higher Criticism,” and he proved his own
book to have been written probably as early as the year
2006. It was all high and hilarious fun, until the enraged
Catholic, the dedicated man, flashed out in the last lines:
“That is how the damned fools write: and with brains of
that standard Germans ask me to deny my God.”<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48">[48]</a></p>

<p>Belloc’s whole historical practice cannot be understood
if it is viewed simply as a reaction against Whiggery. It is
more pointedly a reaction against Historicism. To this
negative side of his work must be added an insight, as
indicated, into a position that is at once traditional, theocentric,
humanist, and because of the union of these things—<i>causal</i>.
If this were all Belloc did as an historian, the palm
of high accomplishment would have been his. But his
superb art added the ring of greatness. Belloc the Grizzlebeard
was never abstracted from Belloc the Poet, and from
Belloc the Sailor. He always entered into the past as the
whole man, the Four Men. After hunting down innumerable
details which gave vividness to the drama of the past,
he re-enacted the story by an act of imaginative reconstruction.
Belloc personally possessed that English gift of visual
imagination that he attributed to Milton. The unification
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
of history and art, played down but never totally suppressed
in the general histories and monographs, blazed
forth in the biographies so powerfully that time was almost
physically conquered. Belloc’s biographical work shows a
constant shifting between a universal view that sees the
whole of Christendom, and an approach that frames the
present in a series of vividly sketched vignettes. He could
transfigure the past. He would haunt the scenes of great
battles and stand in these fields of decision, now emptied
of their glory; his appearance would be timed to the month
and day, and if the exact weather conditions of history did
not prevail, he returned until they did. Some poetic power,
the exact nature of which he often pondered and never
discovered to his satisfaction, was given him, and the past
would roll back before him. A vast and intimate knowledge
of the minutiae of history, informed by his sweeping vision,
seemed to touch the things and places once sanctified or
defiled by men and actions past. Listen to him as the drums
of Wattignies roll down the centuries:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The sleepless men had been launched at last, the hollow lanes
were full of them swarming upward: the fields were ribbed
with their open lines, and as they charged they sang.</p>

<p>Immortal song! The pen has no power over colour or over
music, but though I cannot paint their lively fury or make
heard their notes of triumph yet I have heard them singing:
I have seen their faces as they cleared the last hedges of the
rise and struck the 3,000 upon every side.</p>

<p>... Two charges disputed their certain victory. First, the
Hungarian cavalry ... then the Royal Bourbon, emigrants,
nobles, swept upon the French, heads down, ready to spend
themselves largely into death. They streamed with the huge
white flag of the old Monarchy above them, the faint silver
lilies were upon it, and from either rank the cries that were
shouted in defiance were of the same tongue which since Christendom
began has so perpetually been heard along all the battle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
fronts of Christendom.... These also failed: a symbol in name
and in flag and in valour of that great, once good, and very
ancient thing which God now disapproved.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49">[49]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This kind of writing is art, literary art at its best, wedded
here to historical judgment, keen sensibility, and poetic
vision. This felicitous unity of things not often found
together is not a rare perfection, blessing a dozen odd pages
of a life of historical writing; it is steady, filling volume
after volume, informing and pleasing through the years; a
life’s work of art in which the intended result obtains: the
resurrection of the past, so that the men of the West can
come into their own once again.</p>

“ESTO PERPETUA”</p>
</div>

<p>Today when Western man thinks of Christendom, he
thinks of an historical order that is dead, or he thinks of
an academic humanist tradition that synthesizes the Greek
and Roman heritage with the doctrinal truths of the Faith.
Western man rarely thinks of himself as being a man in
Christendom, for Christendom is no longer a place, existing
in space, enduring in time.</p>

<p>Hilaire Belloc was the last representative of a long tradition
of Catholic thinkers who actually thought of the
Christian Unity in terms of a cultural and geographical
order minted into a unity by the genius of the Faith. His
understanding of Christendom is the most serious problem
facing anyone who would penetrate his thought. Belloc
has been accused of identifying Western Europe and
Catholicism to the point where it would appear that the
Universal Religion was a uniquely Latin thing that carried
with it of necessity the temporal and cultural trappings
of Mediterranean regionalism. “Europe is the Faith, and
the Faith is Europe.”</p>

<p>Belloc’s position is neither so obviously naive as his critics
would assert, nor can it be identified with the attitude of
most contemporary Christians when they think of “Christendom.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
In the first place it is simply false to assert that
he identified Catholicism necessarily with Western Europe.
He expressly states the contrary in the famous and controversial
<i>Europe and the Faith</i>.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50">[50]</a> Operative behind his passionate
and concrete love of European Catholicism is a
doctrinal position that can be stated rather simply: grace
perfects nature, and grace can operate in human nature at
any time and under any conditions, but grace operates the
better, the more perfected is man on the natural level.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It may be taken that whatever form truth takes among men
will be the more perfect in proportion as the men who receive
that form are more fully men. The whole of truth can never
be comprehended by anything finite; and truth as it appears to
this species or to that is most true when the type which receives
it is the healthiest and the most normal of its own kind.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51">[51]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Linked with this doctrinal position is his favorite historical
thesis that Roman Europe represented the very best
man had achieved on the temporal level of existence prior
to the advent of the Son of God. In Rome man began to
come into his own; in Rome man discovered the possibility
of an immortal destiny, because Rome had conceived, even
if imperfectly, the nature of human dignity. Roman man
is Myself, the Four Men—integrated on one level of life
but realizing the essential incompletion of his own handiwork.
Christianity came into the Empire and found there
a mentality peculiarly apt for the reception of the Gospel.
It was with such stuff that the Church molded Western
Europe. The result was Christendom.</p>

<p>The conception of Christendom lies at the heart of Belloc’s
Christian humanism. The necessity for the Faith to
penetrate a culture and erect a civilization that bears her
lineaments is both a deduction from Belloc’s humanism and
an historical cause of his humanism, though it is principally
the latter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>Let us first look to the matter theoretically. There is
no consciously articulated “philosophy of Christendom” in
Belloc, and this for two reasons: Christendom was an historical
fact in his eyes; you do not theorize about the possibility
of that which <i>is</i>; one Thing had preserved the best
of the Roman Order, had sanctified the human hearth, and
had worked toward the erection of a social and personal
dignity unheard-of in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century
England—and this one institution was the Roman
Catholic Church; secondly, and this is a weakness in his
armour, Belloc had little interest in (or talent for) purely
philosophical and theological issues as such; outside of a
vigorous defence of the validity of the human reason
against skepticism, and an almost inarticulate loathing of
German Idealism, he remained aloof from formal philosophy.
Christendom is not a “concept” or a “thesis” for
him: she is Europe and the ages.</p>

<p>Belloc’s failure to elaborate a <i>philosophical</i> defence, as
well as an historical defence, of the theory of Christendom
has left his whole position in jeopardy. Today many
highly reputable minds are questioning the validity of the
very <i>idea</i> of a Christendom. The attack is psychologically
understandable. The older European Order, first wounded
by the Reformation, then weakened spiritually by four
centuries of rationalism, nationalism, and secular liberalism,
now physically and morally ruined by the social conflicts
produced by industrial capitalism, has been rubbled possibly
beyond repair by two world wars. The Christian
community will survive in the new era now being born,
it is said, only if she shakes herself free from the husks of
a culture that no longer exists. Today the East is throwing
off its shackles, and if the Faith is to penetrate into the
rising self-consciousness of these peoples, it must come as
something native to themselves. To cling to an identification
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
of Catholicism and European Catholicism is not only
bad theology, it is bad policy. Catholicism is supra-temporal
and can never be associated essentially with any of the passing
cultural forms that she blesses. It is, then, impossible to
speak of a Christen<i>dom</i> as being some one unique cultural
reality, whose soul is the Faith.</p>

<p>There is more than a little truth to the above reasoning,
and there can be no doubt that Belloc’s dogged passion for
complete, final integration and his deep love for the European
Order rendered him temperamentally incapable of
realizing the <i>concrete</i> possibility of the Faith’s taking root
in a non-European form. To separate the Faith from the
freedom and the institutions of the West was in his eyes
to divorce the mother from its child, and to desecrate that
historical unity that centuries had hallowed. If he overstated
his case, it can be affirmed nonetheless that he had
a case to overstate.</p>

<p>The weakness of the anti-Bellocian position lies in its
sheer abstractionism. In the abstract there is no question
but that the Faith is culturally neutral. But historically it
is simply false to say that the Church has always been, and
could always be, neutral to any given civilization to which
she has come, or will come, preaching salvation. The
Church could never have sanctified Carthage with its human
sacrifice to Moloch; the Church could never have concreted
itself in those border cultures that produced the
Mystery Cults and flirted with the pantheisms of the East.
Belloc fingered a profound historical truth when he declared
that as Revelation incarnates itself the better in a
man in proportion to that man’s natural perfection, so too
Revelation has always embodied itself in any culture in
relation to the degree of corporate perfection achieved by
that society.</p>

<p>If certain cultures as well as certain men seem better disposed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
to receive Faith than others, it is still true that Faith
comes to them as a pure gift. Catholicism did not have to
fix itself within the boundaries of the Greco-Roman world.
But the historical fact is that it did so. That Rome was
more apt to receive the Gospel than were her neighbours
is, to Belloc, one of the clearest truths of Western history.
Those who accuse Belloc of theoretically tying the Church
to Rome confuse two questions: a theological question and
an historical question. Doctrinally, the Faith belongs to no
one by right; but if the Faith does come to a man, it will
come to him as to one formed by a unique set of cultural
exigencies, which will aid or will hinder his reception of
the Divine Gift. The Faith belongs to no culture by right.
Some cultures could never have received her; other cultures
could have, but historically they did not. The fact remains
that she came into Rome, transformed the Empire and
built a Europe that had been humanized to a high level
by the already existing Latin Order.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It may here be objected that to connect so closely the
worldly foundations of our civilization with the Catholic or
universal religion of it, is to limit the latter and to make of it a
merely human thing.</p>

<p>The accusation would be historically valueless in any case,
for in history we are not concerned with the claims of the
supernatural, but with a sequence of proved events in the
natural order. But if we leave the province of history and consider
that of theology, the argument is equally baseless. Every
manifestation of divine influence among men must have its
human circumstance of place and time. The Church might have
arisen under Divine Providence in any spot: it did, as a fact,
spring up in the high <i>Greek</i> tide of the Levant and carries to
this day the noble Hellenic garb. It might have risen at any
time: it did, as a fact, rise just at the inception of that united
Imperial Roman system which we are about to examine. It
might have carried for its ornaments and have had for its sacred
language the accoutrements and the speech of any one of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
other great civilizations, living or dead: of Assyria, of Egypt, of
Persia, of China, of the Indies. As a matter of historical fact, the
Church was so circumstanced in its origins and development
that its external accoutrements and its language were those of
the Mediterranean, that is, of Greece and Rome: of the
Empire.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52">[52]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Such is the principal meaning of <i>Europe and the Faith</i>:
as a matter of fact the Church arose within the bosom of
the Roman Empire; as a matter of fact she alone saved the
imperfectly formed humanism of the classical world; it is
a fact that this tradition was absorbed into the larger Thing
which was the Faith and which made Europe in her own
image. If you would find anywhere on this earth a way
of living that breathed the spirit of Christianity, you would
find it in Western Europe that largely remained faithful
through all the attacks from without, and from all the
schisms from within. A free peasantry, the sacredness of
marriage, the dignity of man, the steady rejection of every
Manichean irresponsibility and of every pantheist negation,
the sacramental view of the universe: these are to be found
in Catholic Europe and wherever else she has stamped her
genius, and they are to be found as corporate doctrines
tending to actuality nowhere else on this earth.</p>

<p>The Church “lays her foundations in something other,”
says Belloc, but “out of that something other came the
art and the song of the Middle Ages.” And he adds his
famous taunt to the Englishmen of his day, “and what art
or song have you?”<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53">[53]</a></p>

<p>Such is the basic Bellocian doctrine on the historical
relationship between Catholicism and European Christendom.
And yet he pushes his position even further in a
daring move that links him with those early Christians
who saw in Rome the special mark of Divine Providence,
preparing a way for the Incarnation. As a man never exists
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
outside of the supernatural order, with the result that even
his natural perfection is achieved under the impetus of
grace, one can say that God is operating with lavish gratuity
wherever a cultural organism is found to have reached
a certain high level of human perfection. Humanism is
crowned by grace, but in a deeper sense, humanism is
caused by grace. “The Church makes men,” Belloc puts it
tersely in one sentence in <i>The Path to Rome</i>.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54">[54]</a> It is small
wonder, then, that when viewing that sweep of Empire
which is the foundation of the West, when seeing that high
pitch of humanism that avoided the Eastern nihilisms, when
gazing at that magnificent legal structure, imperfect
though it was, that had as its end the defining of human
dignity—when seeing all these things, it is no wonder
Belloc frequently talked like those Latin Fathers who saw
in Rome a Unity raised by God to prepare man for the
Incarnation.</p>

<p>Grace not only crowns nature but causes nature to flower
into its fullness. All human values, tending of isolation and
separate destruction outside Catholic Christianity, are unified
within the Body of Christ by the bond of Charity. It
is, therefore, reasonable to believe that the Roman Order—classical
humanism—was created by God for the sake of
the preaching of the Gospel. Compare two passages rather
closely: one was composed around <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 385 by the Christian
poet Prudentius; the other was written in 1906 by
Hilaire Belloc in his <i>Esto Perpetua</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We live in every clime, as if a paternal city enclosed within
its single walls citizens of a single birthplace; we are all one in
heart within our paternal hearth. Now, men from afar and over
land and sea appear before a single and common court; now,
for business and the arts they gather together in the great assembly;
now, they contract marriages and one people is formed
from the mingling of different blood. This has been achieved
by so many triumphant successes of the Roman Empire, believe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
me, that the way has been prepared for Christ’s event, a way
which the communal friendship of our peace has built under
Roman guidance. For, what place could there be for God in a
savage world, in the discordant breasts of men and in those who
guard their own rights by different laws, as was formerly the
case? But, if the mind, from its lofty throne, bridle impulsive
rage and the rebellious organs and bring every passion under
the sway of reason, then is built a stable way of life; then with
surety does it drink in God and live in submission to the one
Lord. Omnipotent One, now is Your hour; penetrate the earth
where no discord reigns. Now, O Christ, the world accepts
You, this world which peace and Rome together hold within
their grasp.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55">[55]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Setting aside details and moving to the heart of the text,
we could say that the poet has laid down the proclamation
of Christendom: a corporate theocentric humanism. Man’s
personal and social integration exists in order that God
may conquer the soul. Now listen to Belloc’s passage as he
sails away from the African shores and faces once more
the Latin Order:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In Europe, in the river-valleys,” I thought, “I will rest and
look back, as upon an adventure, towards journey in this African
land ... I shall be back home. I shall come again to inns
and little towns ... and I shall see nothing that the Latin Order
has not made.” I thought about all these things as the ship
drove on.</p>

<p>Europe filled me as I looked out over the bows, and I saluted
her though she could not see me nor I her. I considered how she
had made us all, how she was our mother and our author, and
how in that authority of hers and of her religion a man was
free. On this account, although I had no wine (for I had drunk
it long before and thrown the bottle overboard), I drank in my
soul to her destiny....</p>

<p>We pass. There is nothing in ourselves that remains. But do
you remain for ever. What happens in this life of ours, which
we had from you, <i>Salva Fide</i>, I cannot tell: save that it changes
and is not taken away. They say that nations perish and that at
last the race itself shall decline; it is better for us of the faith
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
to believe that you are preserved, and that your preservation
is the standing grace of this world.</p>

<p>It was in this watch of the early morning that I called out
to her “<i>Esto Perpetua!</i>” which means in her undying language:
“You shall not die.”...<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56">[56]</a></p>
</div>

<p>We pass over the matchless splendour of the prose until
another time. Suffice it to say that this man has seen something
that calls forth that “piety of speech” reminiscent of
the seventeenth century.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57">[57]</a> As Prudentius sees classical
Roman Europe as caused by God in order to be a highway,
a Roman Road, over which will pass the message of the
Gospel, so does Belloc look back on this prophecy, fulfilled
through a thousand years full of a Christendom, armed,
proud, conscious of its destiny. Aware that nations pass
and that cultures are subject to the cruel laws of time, he
nonetheless prays that historic Christendom may remain
one Thing, “the standing grace of this world.”</p>

<p>To a contemporary thinker, even a contemporary Christian
thinker, Christendom is something apart from himself—an
historic era, good in its day, but its day is now done.
He stands outside of the old European Unity, for it exists
no longer, except perhaps in “the river-valleys,” and in
the mountains, as yet unpenetrated by technological secularism.
<i>He</i> looks to a new synthesis of Christianity with
the modern world, and in desiring this thing he tends to
condemn those who would look back and who would still
hope for the Resurrection of Europe.</p>

<p>But Belloc always saw Christendom as some one historic
Reality, thrusting itself into the dimension of present time—a
Reality within which he has consciously situated himself.
Having become one with the men of old Europe (how he
knew and loved the peasantry and the soldiery of the Continent,
the silent men of South England, and the company
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
of those that sail) he could only look <i>back</i> for corporate
salvation. To look to a new synthesis that transcended the
essential elements of the Roman Order would be for him
to destroy himself. You cannot uproot an unalienated man.</p>

<p>Supporting this hidden marriage with his origins is Belloc’s
firm opposition to the Hegelian conception of history,
in which the old is necessarily overcome by the new, and
in which nothing historical remains that is not powdered
into ashes by an iron determinism. Those men who say
that the old Christendom is dead may be right, but
when they ground their opinion in an historical determinism,
they demonstrate their inability to understand the
<i>organic</i> nature of a traditional society, in which the past
can be renewed through an ever recurrent act of collective
memory.</p>

<p>The old European Christendom that Belloc loved so
well may never come back; its rich cultural diversity, its
personal individualism and patchwork of small property,
its shrines, its liberating chaos—these things can have no
place in a world committed to the principle of technological
and collectivist barbarism. The European way of life died,
not because it had to, but because there were not enough
men left with the will to keep it alive.</p>

<p>Belloc had the will, but his prayer, “You shall not die,”
seems a trifle remote in this fifth decade of the century. It
seems more and more probable that the Christian community
of the future will resemble Communist cells lost in a
world given over to the barbarism of faceless men. The
Faith may, at some future date, arise out of the new catacombs
and be faced with sanctifying a society that is
neither humanist nor humane. Belloc recognized this possibility,<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58">[58]</a>
always believing the contrary more likely. But
should a Christian Order commence to arise out of the
atomic ruins of a mechanical and industrial desert, it will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
work again to the erection of a genuinely human order.
And should the men of this new age wish to know that
freer and broader vision of their half-forgotten fathers,
they could do no better than to turn to the work of this
last of the rooted men.</p>

<p>If the old Christendom is dead, then a new Christendom
will be built in time. Christendom may be considered an
“outmoded concept” by some thinkers who consider the
modern world to have been a necessity. These intellectuals
fail to see that Christendom is rather a fundamental urge,
deep within man, grounded in an ontological need for the
complete integration of man’s spiritual and temporal
destinies.</p>

<p>The issue needs further elucidation. There have been so
many attacks in recent years against the Bellocian position
on the relationship between Europe and Catholicism, and
on his understanding of “Christendom,” that a thorough
airing of the subject is necessary. In the first place, only
an irresponsible writer like Sidney Hook would accuse
Belloc of identifying the interests of Catholicism with the
<i>ancien régime</i>.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59">[59]</a> Belloc gloried in the best traditions of
the Revolution, and, with the exception of Bernanos, he
seems to be the only historian to have grasped the Christian
continuity of the new and the older political traditions of
Europe. He was so much the Republican that he was duped
by the pretensions of Rousseau. The charges of reaction
are not worth the dignity of a formal reply. In the second
place, those quite responsible men who oppose the Bellocian
slogan of “Europe is the Faith” are guilty, not of
irresponsibility, but of a lack of intellectual subtlety. To
state that the Faith is supra-temporal and is thereby never
to be identified with any given civilization is to enunciate
a truism, and to miss the point. It is one thing to say
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
that no cultural order is of the essence of the Faith; it is
another thing to say that the Faith is of the essence of
some given cultural order. The latter is Belloc’s position.
When the Faith is of the essence of that culture, then that
civilization is part of, or coincident with, Christendom.
The historical proof of Belloc’s point lies in the brutal
truth that when that given social order loses the Faith, it
ceases to be itself. Such is the meaning of “Europe is the
Faith.”</p>

<p>More profoundly and more to the heart of the issue is
the objection to conceiving Christendom, if there is or has
been or will be such, as a place. Today probably all would
agree that Christendom is largely a state of mind; but with
Belloc the writer of these pages asserts that Christendom
<i>must become a place</i>, because man is a material as well as
a spiritual creature, existing in space, enduring in time. As
his inner perfection necessitates the interpenetration of the
natural and the supernatural, so too must this inner personal
unity be projected externally in a corporate entity
that ideally could be bounded geographically, politically,
and socially. That God be found in a shrine is a paradox
inherent in the very mystery of the Incarnation. That
man, once he is Christian, will try to build a house
of such a nature that he can say to himself and to his
friends, “This is a place in which Christian men will be
at home,” is the inner meaning of Christendom in the
thought of Hilaire Belloc. He always sought out old
inns, and it was because he hoped to find lingering there
something of the essence of what was once the Christian
Inn of Mankind.</p>

<p>In one sense, a Christian is always an exile. In another
sense, he is an island; and it is in <i>this</i> that is to be found
the heart of the need for Christendom—a <i>corporate</i> theocentric
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
humanism—a <i>place</i> so penetrated by the Faith that
a man who was there could say that “Jesus Christ was in
the morning skies.”<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60">[60]</a></p>

<p>Belloc grasps the older European Christendom, in its
ideals and in the best of its actualities, as a truly human
society, permeated from top to bottom with grace, and
given direction and destiny by the Universal Faith. Personal
perfection necessitates the communal act in which
society is built as a home for man. The City of Man exists
for the furthering of human perfection. The City must
be personal: from this follows Belloc’s detestation of impersonal
governments. The best government would be one
personally exercised by all men, acting together for the
common good. Where this democratic society is impossible
of fulfillment, the community is best incarnated in a monarchy:
one man sums up in himself a people, and one man
is responsible to all.</p>

<p>The Bellocian concepts of both democracy and monarchy
are not co-extensive with the more usually accepted
meanings of those terms. For Belloc democracy is less a
static thing than something dynamic. The French erupting
into the Revolution, organizing great armies and local
governments almost overnight—such is democracy as Belloc
sees it. It is the older ideal of the Citizen assuming personal
responsibility; it is Drouet accepting history at the
crossroads, the Parisians before the Tuileries, man at the
barricades. In Belloc’s eyes the only surviving democracies
in the West are the Swiss cantons and the mountain state
of Andorra. Belloc’s monarchy is one man, symbolizing a
people and its traditions, exercising personal authority, responsible
before the law, a public sacrifice to the land.
He finds his best example in modern times in the United
States of America: in the Office of the Presidency.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61">[61]</a></p>

<p>A personalist society, be it democratic or monarchical,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
will foster those occupations attached directly to fundamentally
human needs. Man needs to build; he needs to
plant and to plow, to make things with his hands, to incarnate
his aspirations in song and the plastic arts; he needs
to fight, and he needs to pray. The peasant, the artisan,
the soldier, the scholar, the poet, the priest—these will
dominate any humanist culture in Belloc’s sense of the term.
A broad base of well-distributed property will lie under the
whole economic organism, insuring the personal character
of the <i>res publica</i>, stamping it with the mark of humanity.
Belloc has little use for a merchant society (exemplified
in his eyes by Carthage and Whig England). The merchant
necessarily is engaged in furthering his own profit,
and he must prosper by feeding on those elements within
the community that are productive. Merchants will always
be in a society, but if the state is controlled by their spirit,
then the City of Man is finished. Profit, not human perfection,
is the bourgeois ideal. Viewed ideally, Belloc’s
humanist society, on which he constructed his distributist
economics, would be characterized by a rich multiplicity
of functions rooted in fundamental human drives.</p>

<p>The City of Man is the extension, the natural fulfillment,
and the guarantee of the personal integration symbolized
by <i>The Four Men</i>. Man, unalienated in the densities of his
own subjectivity, achieves an objective corporate unity
with his fellows. Even the most penetrating and private
of natural mysteries, that of poetic creation, finds its full
significance only in the Forum. “For the Poet, though
divine, is a servant. He is the god of the house of Admetus;
and not all his fellowship with heaven would make him
what he is did he not bring to birth the struggling song,
as yet undelivered in his fellow men.”<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62">[62]</a></p>

<p>Belloc’s ideal of the good social order is not a utopia. The
“proprietary state,” as he calls it, is the natural order of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
things for men, and only the parochialism of a vision that
cannot see beyond the last century on the Continent, or
beyond the Reformation in England, would insist on viewing
industrial capitalism and the consequent Communist
or Collectivist dreariness as advances beyond the simple humanist
order that meshes so beautifully with human nature.
In his final books, written just before the catastrophe of
World War II, Belloc declared that Denmark and Ireland,
and the Portugal of Salazar, were the most decent states
within which man could find his personal and social perfection.
In contemporary cultural theory, there are a number
of parallels to Belloc’s distributist or proprietary ideal.
In the United States a similar conception can be found
in the thought of the Southern Critics. In England,
Mr. T. S. Eliot has advanced a like doctrine in his <i>Notes
Toward the Definition of Culture</i>. Both men conceive of
culture as fundamentally traditional, i.e. organic. Both see
culture as dual: in one dimension it is familial and private;
the attachment of the individual to his ancestral home and
to the proven ways of doing things assures a rhythmic continuity
to society that expresses itself in local patriotism
and the love for the place which is one’s own; status rather
than contract is the ideal, for in status is to be found peace,
both personal and public; on another dimension culture is
public, and the plurality of economic life is given a unity
which flowers in political, artistic, and religious life. However,
two radical divergencies in the thought of Eliot and
Belloc decisively separate their respective humanisms.
Eliot’s society is aristocratic and post-Reformation English
in inspiration; Belloc’s is either democratic or monarchical,
and therefore egalitarian, which is to say that it is Latin
and Catholic in spirit. Eliot sees religious conflicts as making
for a richer cultural diversity. For Belloc the Reformation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
and the rending of Christendom is the greatest scandal
in the story of the West.</p>

<p>In spite of the French antecedents of Belloc’s social
ideals, his proprietary traditions are rooted deeply in the
English past. Most anti-collectivist thinking in the English-speaking
world today looks to Burke and the theory of
prescriptive politics. But for all his conservatism, Burke
never succeeded in dispelling the Whig curse. There is another
tradition that runs back, like a narrow and straight
road, through Chesterton and Belloc to the Tory-Radicalism
of William Cobbett, and beyond to the Cavaliers and
to the King who died for England; there the road broadens
into a great highway filled with the yeomen who rose in
the Pilgrimage of Grace. And beyond all this stands the
high medieval vision of Fortesque: a vision of a land of
free men, eating and drinking their own, owing allegiance
neither to aristocrat nor capitalist, but to God and England
alone.</p>

<p>Such is the City of Man in Hilaire Belloc’s thought. But
this City, Belloc indicates time and again, <i>is not of itself</i>.
It has no fully independent existence of its own, nor can
it ever be a completely autonomous reality. For it to be at
all, it must flourish within the higher City which is the City
of God. Just as the individual man can find his natural
perfection only by losing himself in Christ, so too can the
community of all men find its soul only within the bosom
of Christian Wisdom. Religious truth, absolute and unquestioned,
not only guarantees but causes a God-oriented humanist
culture to come into its own. The sacredness of the
person and the eternal relationship he bears to God through
Christ are truths of an order which is not human, but these
truths act within the bowels of society as Divine Seeds,
conceiving in time a temporal order both personal and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
free. This order is Christendom. It is not the City of God,
but it is within that City, and it is what it is because it is
the child of Faith.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There is a City full, as are all Cities, of halt and maim, blind
and evil and the rest: but it is the City of God.... There are not
two such cities on earth. There is One.</p>

<p>Within that household the human spirit has roof and hearth.
Outside it, is the night.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63">[63]</a></p>

<p class="capsub3">THE FUTURE PLACE OF<br />
HILAIRE BELLOC IN<br />
ENGLISH LETTERS</p>
</div>

<p>He was the finest prose stylist of his generation. His art
was a habit, possessed at the center of his being by a man
who was conscious of his own power. John Edward Dineen
has noted how writers of such diverse interests and talents
as Rupert Brooke, Ford Madox Ford and Max Beerbohm
have paid homage to the literary genius of Hilaire Belloc.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64">[64]</a>
Baring’s famous tribute is well known: “grave prose like
the mellow tones of a beautifully played ’cello ... solemn,
melancholy and majestic.” Belloc’s prose at its finest
was what great prose ought to be: a sensitive instrument
adapted to express, with great precision and subtle nuance,
the complex genius of its creator. His was an artistry that
was largely unmannered, simple, sparing in metaphor, and
still remarkably rich: a prose in a line that stretches back
to the origins of classical English. “No man,” says Lord
Tweedsmuir, “has attained more perfectly to the ‘piety of
speech’ of the seventeenth century; no man has written
purer and nobler prose in the great tradition.”<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65">[65]</a></p>

<p>It is no exaggeration to say that Belloc’s prose, rooted
as it was in the highest literary tradition, will be read as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
long as English prose is read by men trained in that great
heritage. Belloc often put forth the older ideal that prose
should minister rigidly to meaning. To this end he
developed an unadorned, plain style as the apt instrument
for the elucidation of his political and sociological ideas.
<i>The Restoration of Property</i>, <i>The House of Commons and
Monarchy</i>, <i>The Stane Street</i> and, most especially, <i>The
Servile State</i> are the finest examples of Belloc’s working in a
manner that is almost dry in its cold lucidity. The writing
in these books is severely unrhetorical and refreshingly free
from the unavoidable pedantries of contemporary academic
prose; here Belloc achieves personality in his style only by
the constant vigour that informs the whole with an almost
military character: <i>this</i> Belloc is the French logician who
can make an idea march to a conclusion. Belloc’s plain
style recalls the older Oxford manner and suggests the
Newman of the <i>Parochial Sermons</i> and <i>The Arians of the
Fourth Century</i>. Belloc’s lyricism is found perhaps at the
height of its perfection in <i>The Path to Rome</i>, <i>Esto Perpetua</i>,
and in the little-known translation of Bedier’s <i>The
Romance of Tristan and Iseult</i>. But for vintage Belloc, we
must turn to the essays, and most especially to <i>Hills and
the Sea</i>. There is the grave style of “The Death of a
Ship”; there is the delicious parody of his grave style in
“The Lost Manuscript.” Then there is the anecdotal Belloc
telling a story for the sheer love of adventure recalled.
There is the humorous Belloc of the Great Fool passages.
Finally there is the summing up of a life’s vision—once
again, <i>Esto Perpetua</i>.</p>

<p>In the light of such an incomparable artistic mastery,
why is it that Belloc’s reputation has suffered so severely
within the last fifteen years? Part of the neglect is probably
due to the fate of his own generation. The whole
Edwardian and Georgian period is engulfed under the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
snobbery of the <i>avant-garde</i>. The heartiness, the zest for
existence, the enormous Elizabethan interest in almost
everything, the sheer magnificence of the Edwardians seem
pretentious and a trifle adolescent to a youth who has aged
young in an old world now dead. The Bellocs and
Barings and Shaws, diving into the ocean fully clad in
evening dress, seem somewhat beside the point to a generation
embittered in the fires of World War II. The Belloc
who carried burgundy through the streets of Rye tires the
grim and somewhat desperate intellectual of the day.</p>

<p>A change in fashion partially accounts for Belloc’s
decline in popularity, but there is something deeper than
mere fashion. If Belloc is not understood today, it may be
because his own brand of Christian integration has become
almost impossible of achievement at this late date in the
disintegration of the Western World. Most of us are not
rooted men; we do not live in a traditional culture, and
to pretend to do so would be to fall into an archaic lie.
The Christian living in the center of an industrialized
secularism has no Grizzlebeard. His Sailor is dead and his
Poet is without sustenance. Belloc’s “corporate memories,”
and Mr. Eliot’s “piety for the dead,” can be, at best, only
truncated actualities and ideals impossible of immediate
achievement. This is the age of <i>Unheimlichkeit</i>. Man is no
longer at home.</p>

<p>Thinking men turn to those artists who can read the
hidden depths of the contemporary soul, and who can
reveal the nature of the homelessness of modern man.
Thinking Christians turn to the vision of a Mauriac or of
a Greene; they look to an aesthetic penetration into the
human soul as it actually passes by on the anonymous
pavements of the modern world. These men are listened
to because they have captured the wounded spirit of the
day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>Truth, particularly artistic truth, is not pragmatic. But
artistic popularity always is. He who can speak to a man
will be heard. Belloc cannot speak to the latter-day man.</p>

<p>Belloc can only echo the suppressed conscience of those
millions of silent men—the men who bend over nets and
who rest on their plows and who say nothing—the men
who still bear within themselves the dreams and passions
of Christendom: the love of one’s own, the feel for the
soil, the sense of arms, the hunger for certitude. Belloc
speaks for the underground of Europe.</p>

<p>But in some future time, possibly not remote, when
New Man will have exhausted himself attempting to escape
his destiny, when he will have tried all the doors leading
nowhere, when he will have sickened of paper humanisms,
he may turn to the gnarled wisdom and the eternal youth
of this last guardian of the West. If he does, he will learn
what it means to be a man.</p>

written by Belloc that appeared in a volume called “If, Or History
Rewritten”; Belloc speculated, in his essay, on what France would have
been like had the Revolution failed through the Royal Family’s escaping
from the country. Hook, aware of Belloc’s fame as a Catholic apologist,
simply assumes Belloc to imagine a modern Europe continuing the best
traditions of Christendom, had the Revolution failed. But the contrary
is the case. Belloc guesses—rightly or wrongly is beside the point
here—that the Faith would practically be dead on the Continent had the
Revolution failed. It is difficult to see how Hook could have read the
piece and said what he did.)</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
